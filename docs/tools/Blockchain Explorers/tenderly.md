# Tenderly

Tenderly [Developer Explorer](https://docs.tenderly.co/developer-explorer/?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=gnosis) is a development toolbox designed to help developers effectively manage, debug, and monitor their  projects. 

With Tenderly Developer Explorer you can:

* Debug and simulate contracts with the integrated [**Debugger**](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger/?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=gnosis), gaining insights to quickly identify and resolve issues. 
* Monitor deployed contracts and protocols on Gnosis Chain in real-time to ensure optimal performance and stability. 
* Set up critical [alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=gnosis) on contracts to proactively respond to issues and improve security practices. 
* Leverage Developer Explorer with [**Virtual TestNets**](https://docs.tenderly.co/virtual-testnets?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=gnosis) during the entire dapp development process, from testing to staging and go-live.
