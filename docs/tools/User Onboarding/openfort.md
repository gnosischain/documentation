# Openfort

**[Openfort](https://www.openfort.io/?utm_source=gnosis&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=backlinks)** is an open-source wallet infrastructure provider that gives developers the tools to build user experiences that make digital ownership effortless, intuitive, and secure.

Openfort has two major product offerings: **Embedded Wallets** and **Smart Accounts**.

## Embedded Wallets

Openfort's Embedded Wallets allow you to create invisible, non-custodial wallets for your users. You can onboard users with familiar methods like social logins (Google, X, etc.), email, or passkeys, removing the friction of seed phrases. This ensures a smooth onboarding experience while maintaining security and user sovereignty.

## Smart Accounts

Leveraging ERC-4337, Openfort's Smart Accounts unlock powerful features for your application. You can sponsor gas fees to offer a free-to-play experience, batch multiple transactions into a single click, and use session keys to avoid repeated signature requests during gameplay or extended usage.

To summarize, **Openfort** provides the infrastructure for **frictionless Web3 gaming and consumer apps**.

You will be able to use Openfort to power end-to-end wallet interactions on your Web3 app deployed on Gnosis.
