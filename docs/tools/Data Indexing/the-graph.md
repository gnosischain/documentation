# The Graph Data Indexing

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying chain data, supports Gnosis. Data defined through subgraphs is easy to query and explore. Subgraphs can be created locally, or use a free hosted explorer for indexing and data display.

## Setting up a hosted project with TheGraph & Gnosis

:::info
See [The Graph Documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/) for more details, local installation and more.
:::

## Steps:

1) Go to [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/) and setup an account. You will need a GitHub account for authentication.

2) Go to your dashboard and click **Add Subgraph**. Define the subgraph Name, Account, and Subtitle and update the image and other info (you can update later) if desired.


![Basic info is required to create a subgraph. You can modify later if needed.](/img/tools/xdai-graph.png)

3) Install Graph CLI on your machine (using either npm or yarn)

```bash
$ npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
$ yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

4) The following command creates a subgraph that indexes all events of an existing contract. It attempts to fetch the contract ABI from BlockScout and falls back to requesting a local file path. If any of the optional arguments are missing, it takes you through an interactive form.

_*Note: The interactive form does not currently include Gnosis in the dropdown of networks, so using the following flags is useful for a Gnosis deployment._

```bash
graph init
  --from-contract <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
  [--network xdai ]
  [--abi <FILE>]
  <GITHUB_USER>/<SUBGRAPH_NAME> [<DIRECTORY>]
```

--from-contract `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>` is the address of your existing contract.

--abi `<FILE>` is a local path to a contract ABI file (optional, If [verified in BlockScout](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-users/smart-contract-interaction/verifying-a-smart-contract), the graph will grab the ABI, otherwise you will need manually add the ABI. _You can save the abi from BlockScout or by running `truffle compile` or `solc` on a public project._ [_More info available here_](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/)_.)_

The `<GITHUB_USER>` is your github user or organization name, `<SUBGRAPH_NAME>` is the name for your subgraph, and `<DIRECTORY>` is the optional name of the directory where `graph init` will put the example subgraph manifest.

* _Choose the subgraph name created in step 2 as lowercase-hyphenated_

:::

5)  Authenticate with the hosted service

```bash
graph auth https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ <your-access-token>
```

6) cd to the directory you created and start defining the subgraph. Information on creating a subgraph is available in [The Graph Docs](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developing/creating-a-subgraph/)

7) When you are ready, deploy your subgraph. You can always test and redeploy as needed.

```bash
yarn deploy
```

:::success
Your subgraph will be deployed, and you can try sample queries. If you are ready to make it public, select the subgraph and turn off the Hide slider.
