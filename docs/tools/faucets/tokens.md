# ERC20 Token Faucet

The [ERC20 Token Faucet](https://erc20faucet.com/) by [peppersec](https://peppersec.com/) provides a sleek and easy interface for ERC20 test token creation.

The faucet can quickly generate any number of FAU tokens directly from a web interface. These tokens are then available for developers to test smart contract applications and any other token transfer functionality.
