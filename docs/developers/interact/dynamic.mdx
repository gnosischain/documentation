# Using Dynamic

[Dynamic](www.dynamic.xyz) is a powerful web3 auth developer platform with built-in support for Gnosis Chain. It lets you integrate multiple wallets such as Coinbase Wallet, Metamask, and more into your app or website, handles network switching, multi-wallet linking and more.

Dynamic comes with Gnosis Chain built-in. You can play around with a live demo of Dynamic [here](demo.dynamic.xyz)  and see a full video walkthrough [here](https://www.dynamic.xyz/product-walkthrough). In this tutorial, we'll go through how to set up Dynamic with Gnosis Chain.

You can see a CodeSandbox of the example below [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/dynamic-gnosis-chain-demo-vzps4b) (configured to Gnosis Chain).

## Prerequisites

Dynamic works with React today. You can go through the standard getting started guide [here](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/docs/getting-started-with-dynamic). 

## Step 1: Create a Dynamic account

1. [Sign up](https://app.dynamic.xyz) to get an environment ID

2. Create an organization and a set up your first project

3. Copy your `environmentID` from the Dynamic overview page

4. (optional) <a href="doc:security" target="_blank"> Configure your site's CORS origins</a> 

## Step 2: Install the Dynamic npm package

You can install Dynamic's SDK with either `yarn` or `npm`. We currently support React and NextJS.

```shell
npm install @dynamic-labs/sdk-react
# or yarn add @dynamic-labs/sdk-react
```



## Step 3: Configure the SDK

Copy the following snippet into your project and paste in your environmentId:

```javascript
import { DynamicContextProvider, DynamicWidget} from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react';

const App = () => (
  <DynamicContextProvider
     settings={{
       environmentId: 'ID'
    }}>
    <DynamicWidget /> 
  </DynamicContextProvider>
);

export default App;
```



## Step 4: Turn on Gnosis Chain in your developer dashboard

Now that we have the basic Dynamic setup, you can go to your developer dashboard, and select `configurations` from the left menu. Next, click on the `EVM` card and toggle `Gnosis` on. Note that you can also chose to toggle the default network, `Ethereum`, off.

## See it in action

Now that you put things together, you can see a CodeSandbox of the finished product [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/dynamic-gnosis-chain-demo-vzps4b).

## Next steps

Now that you set up Dynamic with **Gnosis Chain**, there are many additional things you can explore:

- **Log in with your wallet, and see data in Dynamic's developer dashboard** - Now that your widget is set up locally, try to log in with a wallet. As soon as you do, head over to the Dynamic developer dashboard and click on user management and analytics. You'll be able to see your user show up!
- **Customize your SDK design** - There are many ways to customize the Dynamic modal to fit your needs (you can explore them in the SDK configuration section), but to start, we suggest setting a light/dark mode and a primary color for the modal, which you can do in the design section of your developer dashboard.
- **Explore how to use the Dynamic SDK** - After your users connect their wallets, you'll want to interact with them for various reasons. You can read more about the SDK in [Dynamic's docs](docs.dynamic.xyz).

For support, you can also join [Dynamic's Slack Community](www.dynamic.xyz/slack).
