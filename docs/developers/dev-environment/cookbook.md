# Using Cookbook
Cookbook is an open source smart contract marketplace. You can search, upload, download, deploy, manage and integrate any Solidity smart contract into your app.

It supports Gnosis Chain and Chiado.

## Search on smart contract marketplace
Navigate to [Cookbook](https://www.cookbook.dev/search?q=), and search for the smart contract you would like to use or deploy:

## Choose the deploy option
Once you've chosen your smart contract, you have different options to select:
1. Simply Deploy: Configure and Deploy the smart contract on the network you chose by few clicks.
2. Edit On Remix: Use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to edit the smart contract
3. Download smart contract: Download the smart contract and use it locally.
