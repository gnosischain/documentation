# Smart Contract Overview

The Gnosis Chain is an EVM based chain, meaning deployment steps are the same as deployment to Ethereum or other chains.

Deploying your Ethereum Dapp on only takes you a few steps:

1. Direct deployment to the proper RPC by replacing the RPC address with a Gnosis chain specific ones
    - For further RPC information, please refer to the [RPC page](/tools/rpc/)
2. Change the network id
3. Change the default network to `gnosis` (or `xdai`)

:::note
The default network will be changed from `xdai` to `gnosis` shortly in some tools and ecosystem integrations
