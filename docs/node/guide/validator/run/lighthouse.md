# Run Validator: Lighthouse

:::caution
The Validator requires a Consensus Client (also known as Beacon Node) in order to operate. See See [Step 3: Run Beacon Node - Lighthouse](../../beacon/lighthouse.md) for more information.
:::

## Option 1: Run as System Process {#system-process}

Refer to [Guide](../../README.md#step-4-run-a-validator)

## Option 2: Run using Docker {#docker}

### 1. Folder Structure

Create new folders:

```shell
mkdir /home/$USER/gnosis/consensus/keystores
mkdir /home/$USER/gnosis/consensus/validators
```

Including the folders from your Execution and Consensus clients, your folder structure should now look like:

```shell
/home/$USER/gnosis/
├── jwtsecret/
├── execution/
└── consensus/
    ├── data/
    ├── keystores/
    └── validators/
```

### 2. Docker Compose

Modify your docker-compose file with your favorite text editor and add the `validator` container. You will also need to add the command `--suggested-fee-recipient=$FEE_RECIPIENT` to your `consensus` container. The file should now look like:

```yaml title="/home/$USER/gnosis/docker-compose.yml" showLineNumbers
version: "3"
services:

  execution:
    # From Step 2
    # ...

  consensus:
    # From Step 3
    # ...

# highlight-start
  validator:
    container_name: validator
    image: sigp/lighthouse:latest-modern
    restart: always
    command: |
      lighthouse
      validator_client
      --network=gnosis
      --datadir=/data/validators
      --beacon-nodes=http://consensus:4000
      --graffiti=$GRAFFITI
      --debug-level=info
      --suggested-fee-recipient=$FEE_RECIPIENT
      --metrics
      --metrics-address=0.0.0.0
      --metrics-port=5064
    networks:
      - gnosis_net
    ports:
      - 5064:5064/tcp
    volumes:
      - /home/$USER/gnosis/consensus/validators:/data/validators
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    logging:
      driver: "local"
# highlight-end

networks:
  gnosis_net:
    name: gnosis_net
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Add an `.env` file with your fee recepient (your Gnosis address) and graffiti in `/home/$USER/gnosis/.env`.

```yaml title="/home/$USER/gnosis/.env"
FEE_RECIPIENT=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
GRAFFITI=gnosischain/lighthouse
```

Replace `suggested-fee-recipient` with your Gnosis address. This fee recipient address will receive tips from user transactions from the block the validator proposed. If not set, the tips will be sent to zero address, that is burnt competely. It is strongly recommended that you configure this value in your setup. Learn more about [suggested fee recipient](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/suggested-fee-recipient.html) flag in Lighthouse docs. 

Replace `graffiti` with your own [graffiti](https://lighthouse-book.sigmaprime.io/graffiti.html). It is an optional field that can be used to add a message to the [block](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/) by the proposer.

### 4. Keystore Location

Add your keystores in `/home/$USER/gnosis/consensus/keystores/` and their password in a file `/home/$USER/gnosis/consensus/keystores/password.txt` to get this file structure:

:::note
Note, keystores MUST follow one of these file names

- `keystore-m_12381_3600_[0-9]+_0_0-[0-9]+.json` The format exported by the `eth2.0-deposit-cli` library ([source](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/2983235650811437b44199f9c94e517e948a1e9b/common/account_utils/src/validator_definitions.rs#L402))
- `keystore-[0-9]+.json` The format exported by Prysm ([source](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/2983235650811437b44199f9c94e517e948a1e9b/common/account_utils/src/validator_definitions.rs#L411))
:::

```shell
/home/$USER/gnosis/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env
├── jwtsecret/
├── execution/
└── consensus/
    ├── data/
# highlight-start
    ├── keystores/
    │   ├── keystore-001.json
    │   ├── keystore-002.json
    │   └── password.txt
    └── validators/
# highlight-end
```


### 5. Import Keystores

Import your validators:

```shell
docker run \
  --rm \
  --volume /home/$USER/gnosis/consensus/keystores:/keystores \
  --volume /home/$USER/gnosis/consensus:/data sigp/lighthouse:latest-modern lighthouse account validator import \
  --network gnosis \
  --password-file /keystores/password.txt \
  --reuse-password \
  --directory /keystores \
  --datadir /data
```


### 6. Start Containers

Start the validator service listed in the compose file:

```shell
cd /home/$USER/gnosis
docker-compose up -d
```


### 7. Monitor Logs

Check your logs for each service (`execution`, `consensus`, or `validator`) with:

import MonitorLogsDockerPartial from '@site/docs/node/guide/validator/_partials/_monitor_logs_docker.md';

<MonitorLogsDockerPartial />


### 8. Make a Deposit

Make a deposit once your node is fully synced (this can take a few hours depending on setup).

:::caution
**At this stage you should have your EL and CL fully synced and validators must be imported to your CL.**
:::

_See section **Fund Validator**_ 


### 9. Updating your Node

To update, just pull the new images, then stop and restart your docker-compose file:

```shell
cd /home/$USER/gnosis
docker-compose pull
docker-compose stop
docker-compose up -d
```
