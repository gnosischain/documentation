title: Voluntary Exit
---

If you decide to stop validating and disable your node, you can initiate a voluntary exit. This will freeze your balance at its current value (rewards and/or penalties will no longer accrue).

If you initiates a voluntary exit, your validator will receive the full staked funds to the withdrawal address, provided that the validator has [withdrawal credentials](withdrawals.md#check-withdrawal-credential) of type `0x01`.

Voluntary exit procedures vary depending on your client.

:::caution
Exits are non-reversible; once you have exited you cannot restart your validator.

You must have a `0x01` type withdrawal address before exiting your validator [withdrawal credentials](withdrawals.md#check-withdrawal-credential).
