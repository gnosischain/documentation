# Stereum

 [Stereum](https://stereum.net/) is a tool to manage the process of setting up & maintaining an Gnosis node for you with a heavy focus on self sovereignty & privacy, and flexibility. Stereum aims to be the most flexible way to leverage your Gnosis node for staking, data science, dApp hosting and development or your own personal use case. We hope to explore every hermitâ€™s dream with you!
