1. Download the latest release of the Gnosis Wagyu Key Gen from [here](https://github.com/alexpeterson91/wagyu-key-gen/releases). There are binaries posted for Windows, macOS, Linux AMD64, and Linux ARM64, choose the appropriate binary for your OS, (or build from the source code if you’re so inclined).

2. Once you have downloaded the appropriate binary for your OS and are disconnected from the internet, go ahead and open the program.  You will be given 2 options, either create a new mnemonic or import an existing mnemonic.  The GUI is very user friendly and explains all steps along the way.  Below are screenshots showing the flow for creating a new mnemonic.  If importing a mnemonic you will need to ensure you select the proper start index on the configuration page so that you don’t create duplicate keys.

Please note that once you have chosen a withdrawal address (either at this step or later), it will not be possible to update it to another address. Therefore, make sure to choose an address that you control and that is secure. :::
