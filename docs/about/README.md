# Gnosis Chain Introduction

Gnosis Chain is a community-owned EVM-based network operated by a diverse set of validators around the world. It is one of Ethereumâ€™s first sidechains focused on resilience and credible neutrality as its core values. Currently, there are over 160,000 validators who secure the network.

Gnosis Chain uses DAO governance mechanism to ensure anyone can participate in the decision-making processes regarding the development and future of the network. Creating dApps and integrating with Gnosis Chain products is similar to any other EVM-based blockchain. You can find more details in the [protocol specification](/about/specs).
