## Overview

### Purpose

- Chiado is a Gnosis testnet that was launched in October 2022
- Chiado's primary purpose is to be a long-lived testnet with tooling for developers
- Chiado's secondary purpose was to test "The Merge", Gnosis' transition from [Proof-of-Authority](../../concepts/specs/consensus/aura.md) to the [Beacon Chain](../../concepts/specs/gbc/README.md).
- Chiado is named after the [Chiado metro station](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baixa-Chiado_(Lisbon_Metro)>) in Lisbon, Portugal.

### Validators

- Chiado is optimized for testnet stability for developers, and has a semi-permissioned validator set similar to Ethereum's [Sepolia testnet](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/06/30/sepolia-merge-announcement)
- Chiado is not intended for broad public validator participation, as frequent cycling of validators affect Testnet stability and make it unreliable for developers (e.g. Ethereum's Prater testnet)
- Chiado validators are run by core contributor teams at [Nethermind](https://nethermind.io/), [Gateway](https://gateway.fm/) and [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/) (and possibly more in the future)
- 6,000 validator keys were defined in the genesis of Chiado Beacon Chain for Gateway, Nethermind and Gnosis to run as validators

### Public Participation

- Community members can still run a full node and go through the Chiado merge as it happens
- 1,000 Testnet GNO on Chiado may be available in the future for community public validator participation
- Community participation will be limited to 14% of the Chiado Network to ensure network stability
- 1 Testnet GNO is required to run a validator, similar to Gnosis mainnet
- Requests for Chiado participation keys can be made in the #chiado-testnet channel in Discord

### How to Participate

- [Running a Chiado node](https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/docs/networks/chiado) with [Nethermind Sedge](https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/)
- (Here by Dragons): If you can get your hands on Testnet GNO on Chiado, you will need to interact with the [deposit contract](https://blockscout.com/gnosis/chiado/address/0xc5be8bf53755a41c2385e7aa86f6a9e28746f466) programmatically, or deploy your own [Deposit UI](/node/manual/validator/deposit#depositing-for-chiado-testnet) with the updated config files

## Previous Iterations

### Chiado 0.2

Chiado was previously launched with network ID 100100. Soon after launch, the network entered a forked state. The root causes were identified and fixed as part of the Chiado relaunch.
