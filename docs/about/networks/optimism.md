:::

An Optimism implementation is deployed on Gnosis. Gnosis functions as the L1 (akin to Ethereum) and Optimism on Gnosis as the L2.

Deployment processes are similar to using [Optimism with Ethereum](https://community.optimism.io/) with updated configs to match the Gnosis chain setup.

| Parameter    | Value              |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Network Name | Optimism on Gnosis |
| Chain ID     | 300                |

## Make a Deposit

:::danger DEPRECATED NETWORK!
Do NOT deposit funds, they will not be withdrawable.
:::

Deposits are initiated through the [Proxy\_\_OVM_L1StandardBridge contract](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/address/0x184a119d4C1D08A459FCfBFe7ECc051c163B4c80/transactions) on the Gnosis Chain with the **`depositETH`** method and the following inputs:

- \_l2Gas: **`200000`**
- data: **`0x`**
- value: **`Deposit value in xDai (ie. 0.1 = 0.1 xDai)`**

:::info
Some smart contract wallets are blocked from calling the `depositETH (and depositERC20) methods`. If you want to deposit using a smart contract wallet you can use the `depositETHTo function instead.`

    <summary>Example using BlockScout</summary>
