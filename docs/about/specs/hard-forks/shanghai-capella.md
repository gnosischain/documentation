# What is Shanghai/Capella hardfork?

Shanghai/Capella hardfork enables validator withdrawal and several execution layer update on Gnosis Chain. EIPs that are included in this hardfork: EIP-3651, EIP-3855, EIP-3860, EIP-6049.

Validator withdrawal allows a validator's account balance get withdrawn from Beacon Chain to Execution Layer, in the form of GNO. The GNO will be accrued on validator's withdrawal address on the Execution Layer, which is set using `eth1_withdrawal_address` option during validator key generation.

Check out [validator withdrawal](/node/management/withdrawals) for more details.

## How to Prepare

### For Validators

1. Check Withdrawal Credentials

   For any type of withdrawals, a validator need to have `0x01` withdrawal credential. You’re fine if you used `--eth1_withdrawal_address` to create your validator keys. If not, tooling will be made available.

   Refer to [validator withdrawal](/node/management/withdrawals#check-withdrawal-credential) for more details.

2. Update your clients

## How to claim your withdrawal?

### Partial Withdrawal

As we have modified some specs regarding the withdrawals to enable withdrawing GNO instead of the native gas token xDai, unlike Ethereum, partial withdrawals currently do not happen automatically. So, for now, you will need to call [`claimWithdrawal`](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x0b98057ea310f4d31f2a452b414647007d1645d9#writeProxyContract#F3) function on the [contract](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x0b98057ea310f4d31f2a452b414647007d1645d9#writeProxyContract). However, it is in our plans to automate and subsidize partial withdrawals in the future.
