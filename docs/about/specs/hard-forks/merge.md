:::danger
Hard forks are backward-incompatible upgrades used to introduce new functionality or fix security related issues. They are backward-incompatible upgrades, requiring all nodes to upgrade to the latest version to avoid syncing to a pre-fork blockchain.

# The Merge

In early December 2022, Gnosis underwent the Merge. The Gnosis execution layer (formerly xDai) has been merged with the [Gnosis Beacon Chain](../gbc/README.md), in a process similar to the [Ethereum merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/).

The Merge represents an important shift for Gnosis, replacing the legacy [Proof-of-Authority consensus](../consensus/aura.md) with the open and unpermissioned [Beacon Chain Consensus](../gbc/README.md). This allows Gnosis to transition to a fully decentralized and permissionless proof-of-stake network.

The Merge is also another step in Gnosis' journey together with Ethereum. From the early days of xDai at ETHDenver, Gnosis has had a role in Ethereum's journey. With the adoption of Ethereum's consensus mechanism, Gnosis will continue to contribute to Ethereum's growth as an experimental chain, where newcomers, experiments and ideas are welcome.

## When did the Merge happen?

:::tip

The week of 5th Dec 2022

:::

On the 9 Nov 2022 Gnosis Core Devs call, it was agreed to target **the week of 5th Dec 2022** for the Merge. Due to variances in block time, the Merge will likely happen sometime from **5th to 11th Dec 2022.**

### TTD

With the 5th Dec 2022 target in mind, the Core Devs have proposed the following TTD value:

```
8626000000000000000000058750000000000000000000
```

This number was not chosen randomly: to pay tribute to the Ethereum Merge, Core Devs have proposed to include [Ethereum's TTD](https://notes.ethereum.org/@MarioHavel/merge-ttd), `58750000000000000000000`, in the Gnosis Merge TTD.

### Bellatrix

Similar to Ethereum, the Gnosis Beacon Chain have had a [Bellatrix epoch](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/24/mainnet-merge-announcement) that occurred prior to the Merge.

:::danger

The Bellatrix upgrade is a hard fork. Nodes that aren't upgraded when the upgrade is released risk syncing to a pre-fork blockchain.

### For DApps

- The Merge deprecated Gnosis' RandomAuRa on-chain randomness, and developers should find alternatives
- Gnosis' Merge will be similar to the Ethereum Merge, and DApps should prepare accordingly for changes to `block.difficulty`, blockhash randomness, and block times and finalization.
- We recommend the Ethereum.org article on [How the Merge affects the Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer)
- We recommend 0xMacro's post on [What Solidity Devs should know about Ethereum's Merge](https://0xmacro.com/blog/what-solidity-devs-should-know-about-ethereums-merge/)
