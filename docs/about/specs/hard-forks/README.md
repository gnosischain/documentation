# Hard Forks

:::danger
Hard forks are backward-incompatible upgrades used to introduce new functionality or fix security related issues. They are backward-incompatible upgrades, requiring all nodes to upgrade to the latest version to avoid syncing to a pre-fork blockchain.

Validators will receive instructions to update their nodes in the event of a hard fork.
:::

Information related to a hard fork will be posted. If any assistance is needed, feel free to reach out or ask questions through [Discord](https://discord.gg/gnosischain), the [forum](https://forum.gnosis.io) or other channels.
