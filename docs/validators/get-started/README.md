# Validator Info

Validators protect the Gnosis Chain by staking on the Gnosis Beacon Chain. There are several options now available for staking.

### Run Your Own Node

Please see the [Validator Responsibilities](/validators/get-started/responsibilities) and [Technical Requirements](/validators/get-started/technical-requirements) to learn more about expectations and what you will need to become a validator.Validating the GBC requires 1 GNO per validator process.

:bulb:Want to learn the basics about validating on the beacon chain? [This is a good first article to start](https://medium.com/alethio/ethereum-2-a-validators-journey-through-the-beacon-chain-843f70aaab2e) (covers the Ethereum Beacon Chain, but processes are similar on GBC only faster: 5 sec blocks and 16 slots per epoch).
