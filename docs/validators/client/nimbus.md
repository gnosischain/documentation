# Nimbus

### Nimbus

Nimbus is a lightweight client implementation designed for low resource usage. This allows it to perform well on embedded systems, resource-restricted devices including Raspberry Pis, and mobile devices.

Nimbus is built in Nim under an Apache 2.0 License. [More on the Nimbus and team behind it](https://nimbus.team).

### Using Nimbus as a Gnosis Beacon Chain Validator

The original Nimbus binaries do not support Gnosis Beacon chain out-of-the-box, however GBC specific binaries still can be built from source. For convenience, we provide easy to use prebuilt docker images in our GBC Nimbus Repo.
