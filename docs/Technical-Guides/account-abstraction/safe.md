# Building Account Abstraction with Safe
[Safe](https://docs.safe.global/) provides a variety of Account Abstraction stacks for developers to integrate and build Account Abstraction on top of Safe. 

[Safe ](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core) suites:
1. [Safe Account Abstraction SDK](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk)
2. [Safe API](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-api)
3. [Safe \{Core\} Protocol](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-protocol)

## Safe Account Abstraction SDK
<!-- ![](../../../static/img/developers/Safe/safe-AA-SDK.png) -->

Safe\{Core\} Account Abstraction SDK allows developers to create AA functionalities into their apps.

### [Protocol Kit](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit)
Protocol Kit provides functionalities such as creating new Safe accounts, updating the configuration of existing Safes, and proposing and executing transactions.

For more details, see [Guide: Integrating the Safe Core SDK](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/blob/main/guides/integrating-the-safe-core-sdk.md) and [Safe Core SDK API Reference](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-core-sdk/tree/main/packages/protocol-kit#sdk-api)

Follow the [tutorial on Safe](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/protocol-kit#quickstart) to **create a 2 of 3 multi-sig Safe** and propose and **execute a transaction** to send some ETH out of this Safe.

### [Auth Kit](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/auth-kit)
Auth Kit enables users to sign in using an email address, social media account, or traditional crypto wallets like Metamask. It creates an Ethereum/Gnosis address and let users to authenticate the account using above-mentioned authentication methods.

Follow the [tutorial on Safe](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/auth-kit#quickstart) to create a Signing Account using your email or social media account. Once authenticated, you can sign transactions and interact with any Safe Smart Accounts you own.

### [Onramp Kit](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/onramp-kit)
Onramp Kit allows users to buy cryptocurrencies using a credit card or other payment methods.
This package is provided for testing purpose only. Please use it at your own risk.

Follow the [tutorial on Safe](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/onramp-kit#quickstart) to create a React component that allows you to enter an Ethereum address and fund it using a credit card. The full code example can be found in the [Safe Space repo](https://github.com/5afe/safe-space) in the [WalletFund.tsx](https://github.com/5afe/safe-space/blob/onramp-kit-integration/src/scenes/Wallet/WalletFund.tsx) file in [PR #8](https://github.com/5afe/safe-space/pull/8). We will also be using a [pre-deployed server](https://github.com/5afe/aa-stripe-service).

### [Relay Kit](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/relay-kit)
Relay Kit allows users to pay transaction fees (gas fees) using the native blockchain token or ERC-20 tokens. This allows you to pay gas fees using any ERC-20 token in your Safe, even if you don't have ETH.

Currently, the Relay Kit is only compatible with [Gelato relay](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay). There are two ways to use Gelato relay:
1. [Gelato 1Balance](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/payment-and-fees/1balance-and-relay): Using prepaid deposit(via USDC on Polygon for mainnet, via gETH on Goerli for testnet) to funds the 1Balance account.With the deposit on 1Balance account, the Relay Kit can sponsors a transactions to other Safe within or on another chain. 
2. [Gelato SyncFee](https://docs.gelato.network/developer-services/relay/non-erc-2771/callwithsyncfee): Allows you to execute a transaction and pay the gas fees directly with funds in your Safe, even if you don't have ETH on Ethereum or xDAI on Gnosis Chain.


Follow the [tutorial on Safe](https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-account-abstraction-sdk/relay-kit#quickstart) to send some tokens to another address using the Relay Kit to pay for he gas fees.
