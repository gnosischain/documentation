12. I was staking xdai on the easystaking xdai site and it is no longer active. How can I access my xdai?

    This has been down for some time now due to the old team that was running xdai not maintain it anymore. You will need to use the block explorer to interact with the contracts without the UI in oder for it to be withdrawn.

    These are the steps that need to be taken:

    https://etherscan.io/address/0xecbcd6d7264e3c9eac24c7130ed3cd2b38f5a7ad#readProxyContract 11. lastDepositIds Type your address which gives you a number. 3. balances Find your deposits. They are numbered from 0 up to the number you got previously. Check all of them.
    https://etherscan.io/address/0xecbcd6d7264e3c9eac24c7130ed3cd2b38f5a7ad#writeProxyContract 7. makeForcedWithdrawal Withdraw. Please note this instant-withdrawal has a 2% fee

13. I recently transferred an ERC-1155 into a safe. I realized after the fact that gnosis does not support 1155s. Is there a way that I’m able to transfer it back out?

    You have to use “contract interaction” on the safe when you click on “New Transaction”
    On the pop up, you will put in the contract address of the ERC-1155 token - (It may or may not automatically pull in the ABI so you may have to copy that from the contract details via gnosis scan)

    Once, the contract address and abi is input into the prompt… there should be a drop down of which functions are available to you. You want to drop down to “safeTransferFrom”

    When you select that, you will have prompts to fill in:
    From(address) - that address that owns the token - your safe
    To(address) - what wallet do you want to send it to?
    id(uint256) - The token number of the NFT
    amount(uint256) - How many of those tokens do you want to send? - usually just 1
    data(bytes) - I just put in " 0x0 " empty data.

    Add that transaction - then sign it off and that should work
    if you are still having issues i would suggest to hop into the Safe discord and ask for further assistance there.
