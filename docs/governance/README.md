# Governance

Gnosis Chain features several governance processes depending on the purpose and requirements.

* [Community Governance](/governance/community): As a community-driven chain, GNO holders within the community play a prominent role in determining the direction and goals of the Gnosis Chain.  Community members can advance improvement proposals and engage in discussion on the Gnosis Forum. 
* [Bridge Governance](/governance/bridge): The native bridges connecting Gnosis Chain to Ethereum (and other chains) provide vital infrastructure for the chain. Decisions and power must be distributed to increase security and decentralization, but also must be handled by those with expertise, and at times must be made in an expedited fashion. The bridge governing board is composed of projects with experience and a strong interest in continuing the success of the Gnosis Chain.
