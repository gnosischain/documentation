​✅ **Implemented:** May 03, 2022

### Update Bridge Fee Receiver to GnosisDAO

​🗳️ **Justification:**  Bridge responsibility is migrating to GnosisDAO, and fees should be sent to a GnosisDAO owned safe.

* Removed existing recipient

​✅ **Implemented in batch:** May 03, 2022

### Increase Default Daily Limits of AMB Bridge

​🗳️ **Justification:**  To support projects looking to move large amount of tokens from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain, increase the limits from 10^9 to 10^18 to enable transfer in a single tx.

​✅ **Implemented:** May 11, 2022

### Increase Limits for **xDAI, USDC and USDT**

​🗳️ **Justification:**  Due to market conditions, stablecoin bridge limits should be temporarily raised to ensure leveraged positions are not liquidated due to inability to bridge.

​✅ **Implemented:** May 12, 2022

### **Remove Validator from the AMB Validator Set**

​🗳️ **Justification:**  This odd-numbered validator run by the xDai team is redundant and should be removed from the set.

​✅ **Implemented:** May 24, 2022

### **Decrease Withdrawal Fee on OmniBridge for CommonGround**

​✅ **Implemented:** June 14, 2022

### Remove Former xDai Team Validators from AMB & xDAI Bridges

​🗳️ **Justification:**  xDai validators were important at the early stages of the project to ensure operational execution and bridge functionality. Now, with increased community involvement and ecosystem maturity, the next step is to further decentralize processes and remove the former xDai team.

​✅ **Implemented:** June 14, 2022

## 2021

### Add Syncnode as Governor / xDai Bridge Oracle

​🗳️ **Justification:**  Increase decentralization by extending the governance and the bridge validators set to include Syncnode.

​✅ **Governor Set Implemented:** January 22, 2021 \
​✅ **Oracle Implemented:** January 7, 2021

### Upgrade Bridge Contracts

​🗳️ **Justification:**  A number of updates were made to the contracts to facilitate user engagement, support costs for xDai transfers, and provide logic for rebasing tokens. The minimum amount per token transaction was reduced to 1 wei (primarily to support LP tokens or other token fractions) and fees were set to 0.1% for xDai to Dai transfers.

​✅ **Implemented:** March **** 15, 2021

### Increase finalization time on Ethereum Mainnet

​🗳️ **Justification:**  \
