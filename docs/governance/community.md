# Community Governance

Community members and GNO holders can [create and vote on proposals](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/readme-gnosisdao-governance-process/736) related to changes, improvements or anything they would like to see with the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.

First, a proposal is discussed in an open-ended fashion, then a forum poll is initiated, and finally a snapshot vote is conducted. Anyone can discuss and participate, and GNO holders on Ethereum mainnet, the Gnosis Chain, or those who lock GNO in a variety of protocols on either network can vote on a proposal.

## Governance Process Phases

The following info is from the [GnosisDAO forum](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/readme-gnosisdao-governance-process/736). Please visit for more details and to start or comment on an active proposal.
