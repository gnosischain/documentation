# Secret Network

On most blockchains, all data is public by default. While this works for many of the popular Web3 applications we see today, having the ability to keep some data confidential unlocks powerful new capabilities. Incorporating decentralized confidential computing (DeCC) enables things like private voting for DAOs, secure random number generation for gaming, encrypted databases for various applications, encrypted data tied to NFTs, sealed-bid auctions, and encrypted order books for DeFi applications. All of this can be built on Gnosis by utilizing [Secret Network](https://scrt.network)’s Confidential Computing Layer.

## Integrating Secret's Confidential Computing Layer​

You can integrate Secret’s CCL into an existing Gnosis application, or design a new application from the ground up to take advantage of the unique use-cases it enables.

To start, check out Secret Network’s [Confidential Computing Layer](https://scrt.network/confidential-computing-layer) landing page to get an overview of how it works, and example use-cases for inspiration. From there you’ll find multiple links to Secret's CCL documentation:

1. [Basics](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/basics) - explains the cross-chain communication technologies used, and how to connect a MetaMask wallet to Secret Network.

2. [Use-cases](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/usecases) - provides tutorials showing how to build various types of EVM applications using Secret’s CCL. All of these tutorials can be used to deploy a contract on Gnosis.

3. [Supported Networks](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/supported-networks) - provides a list of gateway contract addresses. This is how your Gnosis application will communicate with Secret.
