# Governance Decisions

The [Bridge Governance Board](./#current-bridge-governors) is responsible for enacting updates related to bridge functionality, contract upgrades, and other parameters impacting bridge operations. The following items have been implemented by the board.

## Safe contract updates, two new governor wallets and Gateway validator addition.

ðŸ—³ Justification: We executed a regular/routine update for all Safe contracts. Additionally, we added one more validator (7 in total), strengthening even further the resilience of the bridges. Finally, we replaced two recently inactive wallets with new participants that will participate in the governance more actively.

âœ… Implemented: March 20, 2023

## Adjust limits on ETH-GC OmniBridge for WETH, WBTC, GNO, CLNY, DXD, HOPR, HAUS

ðŸ—³ Justification: For risk management purposes, the daily limits for transactions from Gnosis Chain to Ethereum where raised for major assets and were adjusted to reasonable values for some smaller assets.

âœ… Implemented: February 23, 2023

## Add Karpatkey and remove Syncnode from the set of validators of AMB & xDAI Bridges

ðŸ—³ Justification: Syncnode team requested to be removed from the validator set. In the same time addition of Karpatkey validator creates additional reliability and decentralization of validators set.

âœ… Implemented: December 4, 2022


## Remove Funds from lending protocols AAVE and Compound and disable Interest Function on Omni Bridge and xDAI Bridge

ðŸ—³ Justification: reduce risk and exposure during the uncertainty that came with the merge. After the merge, a new strategy must be developed in order to define how to approach this type of investment considering the implications related to transparency to the users and the risk involved.

âœ… Implemented: September 14, 2022


## Remove Former xDai Team Validators from AMB & xDAI Bridges

ðŸ—³ Justification:  xDai validators were important at the early stages of the project to ensure operational execution and bridge functionality. Now, with increased community involvement and ecosystem maturity, the next step is to further decentralize processes and remove the former xDai team.

âœ… Implemented: June 14, 2022


## Disable Deposit Function in StakingAura POSDAO contract

ðŸ—³ Justification:  Staking is deprecated in POSDAO. Current validators will continue until the Gnosis Chain <-> Gnosis Beacon Chain merge but no new deposits are allowed.

## Swap Governance Account Address

ðŸ—³ Justification:  Account for the former xDai team needs to be updated in the Governance Gnosis Safe.

âœ… Implemented: June 03, 2022


## Decrease Withdrawal Fee on OmniBridge for CommonGround

ðŸ—³ Justification:  The Common Ground token withdrawal fees should be set to 0 when bridging from Gnosis Chain to Ethereum to help promote adoption.  

âœ… Implemented: May 30, 2022 


## Remove Validator from the AMB Validator Set

ðŸ—³ Justification:  This odd-numbered validator run by the xDai team is redundant and should be removed from the set.  

âœ… Implemented: May 24, 2022


## Increase Limits for xDAI, USDC and USDT

ðŸ—³ Justification:  Due to market conditions, stablecoin bridge limits should be temporarily raised to ensure leveraged positions are not liquidated due to inability to bridge.

âœ… Implemented: May 12, 2022


## Increase Default Daily Limits of AMB Bridge

ðŸ—³ Justification:  To support projects looking to move large amount of tokens from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain, increase the limits from 10^9 to 10^18 to enable transfer in a single tx.

âœ… Implemented: May 11, 2022


## Update Bridge Fee Receiver to GnosisDAO

ðŸ—³ Justification:  Bridge responsibility is migrating to GnosisDAO, and fees should be sent to a GnosisDAO owned safe.

* Removed existing recipient

âœ… Implemented in batch: May 03, 2022


## Update Bridge Fee Receiver to GnosisDAO

ðŸ—³ Justification:  Bridge responsibility is migrating to GnosisDAO, and fees should be sent to a GnosisDAO owned safe.

âœ… Implemented: April 26, 2022


## Decrease Daily Limit Amounts for Bridge Transactions

ðŸ—³ Justification:  Increase the bridge security by decreasing the allowable daily limits for the following assets:

* xDAI - 3â€™000â€™000 (4%)
* USDC - 2â€™500â€™000 (3%)
* USDT - 1â€™500â€™000 (4%)
* WETH - 250 (3%)

* xDai: 4/6
* AMB OmniBridge 5/8

âœ… Implemented (in series of txs) March 26, 2022

## Update Governing Body

ðŸ—³ Justification:  Add additional governors to increase decentralization and remove several inactive validators. A series of related proposals accomplished the following:

âœ… Implemented: December 22, 2021


## Decrease OmniBridge withdrawal fee for WETH

ðŸ—³ Justification: Incentivize users to move operations to the Gnosis Chain

âœ… Implemented: December 03, 2021

## Increase finalization time on Ethereum Mainnet

ðŸ—³ Justification:  
Increase the amount of blocks required for confirmation on the Ethereum Mainnet to 20, increaseing bridge operation reliability and security (less chances for re-orgs). This update slightly delays user transfers from 2.5 minutes to \~4 minutes.

âœ… Implemented: August 20, 2021


## Reduce USDC withdrawal fees to 0 for 3 months

ðŸ—³ Justification: Current exit fees for USDC transfers on OmniBridge are currently 0.1%. The primary purpose of this temporary 3-month reduction to 0 fees is to attract more protocols utilizing USDC and OmniBridge for their activities.

âœ… Implemented: June 15, 2021


## Return user funds

ðŸ—³ Justification:  A user accidentally [sent over 2000 USDC](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tx/0x2837cd89972f2e37a1cb631e60dbb761213010fe526a089c99f48ed483f63956) to the USDC token contract on Gnosis.

âœ… Implemented: March 15, 2021


## Add Syncnode as Governor / xDai Bridge Oracle
