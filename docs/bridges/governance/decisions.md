# Governance Decisions

The [Bridge Governance Board](./#current-bridge-governors) is responsible for enacting updates related to bridge functionality, contract upgrades, and other parameters impacting bridge operations. The following items have been implemented by the board.

## Increase required block confirmation for AMB to 130 blocks, remove Autonolas LP token fee

ðŸ—³ Justification: To increase the participation of the Telepathy light client on the AMB, we [increase the required block confirmations](https://app.safe.global/transactions/tx?safe=eth:0x42F38ec5A75acCEc50054671233dfAC9C0E7A3F6&id=multisig_0x42F38ec5A75acCEc50054671233dfAC9C0E7A3F6_0xbd070bf3e3a1047b073d00c34fb73b39dd24678dd41c6f0c6855fec8411de165) from 100 blocks (~20 mins) to 130 blocks (~26 mins). This will ensure that the majority of the txs can be signed by Telepathy. End users should expect 6 more minutes delay.
Besides, as requested from Autonolas team, we [remove the Autonolas LP token fee](https://app.safe.global/transactions/tx?safe=gno:0x7a48Dac683DA91e4faa5aB13D91AB5fd170875bd&id=multisig_0x7a48Dac683DA91e4faa5aB13D91AB5fd170875bd_0x27127a754307d26d7a9a4bfdcb01242103212ebec979039702e12de615125af5) on ETHâ†”GC Omnibridge, from previously 0.01% to 0.

âœ… Implemented: Dec 18, 2023

## Remove OLAS token fee from ETH-GC Omnibridge

ðŸ—³ Justification: As requested from Autonolas team, we [removed OLAS token fee](https://app.safe.global/transactions/tx?safe=gno:0x7a48Dac683DA91e4faa5aB13D91AB5fd170875bd&id=multisig_0x7a48Dac683DA91e4faa5aB13D91AB5fd170875bd_0x4efc19db4b29b2812b17e74cf4f8c91eef02a68a966a64617810c74589f5ab8b) on ETHâ†”GC Omnibridge, from previously 0.01% to 0.  
OLAS on Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0001a500a6b18995b03f44bb040a5ffc28e45cb0  
Bridged OLAS token on Gnosis: https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xce11e14225575945b8e6dc0d4f2dd4c570f79d9f

âœ… Implemented: Nov 9, 2023

## Savings xDAI launch - Initiate sDAI interest bridging and increase xDAI bridge limits.

ðŸ—³ Justification: This is a follow-up on the previous proposal. After the successful upgrade of the xDAI bridge to deploy reserves on the sDAI vault, we launched the Savings xDAI vault on Gnosis chain which will distribute the interest earned on mainnet to holders of the sDAI token on Gnosis chain. We [set interest receiver](https://app.safe.global/transactions/tx?safe=eth:0x42F38ec5A75acCEc50054671233dfAC9C0E7A3F6&id=multisig_0x42F38ec5A75acCEc50054671233dfAC9C0E7A3F6_0x933bd8409a8f46789ee29d50af1c10ed40378e05705681c8530aa744eb322ac5) to the interest receiver contract on Gnosis Chain.

We [increased the limits](https://app.safe.global/transactions/tx?safe=gno:0x7a48Dac683DA91e4faa5aB13D91AB5fd170875bd&id=multisig_0x7a48Dac683DA91e4faa5aB13D91AB5fd170875bd_0x330f022997f6cb47b9d9643ebf032871bc0ffb82a0a3ee8e1020649de22dc6ec) for incoming xDAI transactions to Gnosis chain as we are anticipating higher volumes due this launch. Previous value: 10 million. New value: 15 million.

âœ… Implemented: Oct 5, 2023

## Upgrade xDAI bridge to support investing in sDAI vault.

ðŸ—³ Justification: We [upgrade](https://app.safe.global/transactions/tx?safe=eth:0x42F38ec5A75acCEc50054671233dfAC9C0E7A3F6&id=multisig_0x42F38ec5A75acCEc50054671233dfAC9C0E7A3F6_0xd8683bccfe39ace95a1da5f58a5c9a83dc324de39ce07f11fcffb5c2397ca96c) [xDAI bridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4aa42145Aa6Ebf72e164C9bBC74fbD3788045016#readProxyContract) to new implementation version in order to support investing DAI from the bridge contract into sDAI vault from Spark Protocol. This upgrade only implements changes on Ethereum, and the next phase will be on Gnosis Chain. The implementation contract is [audited by Omega and ChainSafe](../audits.md#xdai-bridge-upgrade-audit-by-omega-and-chainsafe). For more details, please refer to [docs](../tokenbridge/xdai-bridge.md#savings-xdai)

We call the method `upgradeTo()` on the xDAI bridge proxy contract (0x4aa42145aa6ebf72e164c9bbc74fbd3788045016) with parameters: version 8 and impl. 0x166124b75c798cedf1b43655e9b5284ebd5203db.

We call the `initializeInterest()` with the following parameters.

```
- DAI: 0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f
- minCashThreshold: 1000000000000000000000000 (1,000,000 DAI)
- minInterestPaid: 1000000000000000000000 (1,000 DAI)
- interestReceiver: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

We also call `investDAI()` to invest the DAI into MakerDSR. 25m DAI have been [deposited into sDAI vault](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x291d48fdfd430165b2b7f62c3ae806ea28ab34b4dc8a2e4d7d01693f19b780c9) earning interest.

[refillBridge()](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4aa42145Aa6Ebf72e164C9bBC74fbD3788045016#writeProxyContract#F3) will be called periodically (once per day at the moment) by the Karpatkey team to ensure that there is enough DAI for withdrawal on Ethereum.

âœ… Implemented: Sept 20, 2023

## Add Telepathy Validator in the AMB

ðŸ—³ Justification: Adding the Telepathy validator in the AMB as the 8th validator.

Telepathy is a light client based validator developed by SuccinctLabs. Main goal is to increase security of the bridge by adding a validator that is not based on trusted off-chain agents but on verifying the transactions based on the Ethereum consensus layer.
We are also increasing the minimum required block confirmations to 100 blocks so that the Telepathy validator has enough time to participate in the transaction affirmation process.  
This initiative is part of this proposal that started a year ago:
https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-57-should-gnosis-dao-support-research-of-a-zksnark-enabled-light-client-and-bridge/5421  
More details on the design: https://hackmd.io/@wdyZgTm3RrOsm-rhXDXEHA/BJ_7ExKgn

âœ… Implemented: Jul 3, 2023

## Remove two governor wallets, add three new governor wallets and remove HAUS token fee.

ðŸ—³ Justification: We removed two inactive governor wallets from ex-xDAI team and add three new governor wallets: Succinct Labs, Agave, Gnosis Bridge team. Additionally, we increased governance Safe walletâ€™s threshold from 7 to 8, resulting in 8-of-16 requirement to pass a proposal, strengthening the resilience of the bridge governance. Besides, as requested from DAOHAUS team, we removed HAUS token fee, making it a complete fee-less operation to bridge HAUS token between ETH and Gnosis Chain.

âœ… Implemented: Jun 12, 2023

## Upgrade BNB-GC Omnibridge mediator to stop accepting any new token locks and mints

ðŸ—³ Justification: As part of the longer term plan to decommission the BNB-GC Omnibridge (more info [https://forum.gnosis.io/t/bridge-to-binance-update/6624](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/bridge-to-binance-update/6624)), we want to stop any new token locks and mints from either BNB chain or Gnosis Chain.

âœ… Implemented: April 4, 2023

## Safe contract updates, two new governor wallets and Gateway validator addition.

ðŸ—³ Justification: We executed a regular/routine update for all Safe contracts. Additionally, we added one more validator (7 in total), strengthening even further the resilience of the bridges. Finally, we replaced two recently inactive wallets with new participants that will participate in the governance more actively.

âœ… Implemented: March 20, 2023

## Adjust limits on ETH-GC OmniBridge for WETH, WBTC, GNO, CLNY, DXD, HOPR, HAUS

ðŸ—³ Justification: For risk management purposes, the daily limits for transactions from Gnosis Chain to Ethereum where raised for major assets and were adjusted to reasonable values for some smaller assets.

âœ… Implemented: February 23, 2023

## Add Karpatkey and remove Syncnode from the set of validators of AMB & xDAI Bridges

ðŸ—³ Justification: Syncnode team requested to be removed from the validator set. In the same time addition of Karpatkey validator creates additional reliability and decentralization of validators set.

âœ… Implemented: December 4, 2022

## Remove Funds from lending protocols AAVE and Compound and disable Interest Function on Omni Bridge and xDAI Bridge

ðŸ—³ Justification: reduce risk and exposure during the uncertainty that came with the merge. After the merge, a new strategy must be developed in order to define how to approach this type of investment considering the implications related to transparency to the users and the risk involved.

âœ… Implemented: September 14, 2022

## Remove Former xDai Team Validators from AMB & xDAI Bridges

ðŸ—³ Justification: xDai validators were important at the early stages of the project to ensure operational execution and bridge functionality. Now, with increased community involvement and ecosystem maturity, the next step is to further decentralize processes and remove the former xDai team.

âœ… Implemented: June 14, 2022

## Disable Deposit Function in StakingAura POSDAO contract

âœ… Implemented: May 24, 2022

## Increase Limits for xDAI, USDC and USDT

ðŸ—³ Justification: Due to market conditions, stablecoin bridge limits should be temporarily raised to ensure leveraged positions are not liquidated due to inability to bridge.

âœ… Implemented: May 12, 2022

## Increase Default Daily Limits of AMB Bridge

ðŸ—³ Justification: To support projects looking to move large amount of tokens from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain, increase the limits from 10^9 to 10^18 to enable transfer in a single tx.

âœ… Implemented: May 11, 2022

## Update Bridge Fee Receiver to GnosisDAO

ðŸ—³ Justification: Bridge responsibility is migrating to GnosisDAO, and fees should be sent to a GnosisDAO owned safe.

âœ… Implemented: April 26, 2022

## Decrease Daily Limit Amounts for Bridge Transactions

ðŸ—³ Justification: Increase the bridge security by decreasing the allowable daily limits for the following assets:

- xDAI - 3â€™000â€™000 (4%)
- USDC - 2â€™500â€™000 (3%)
- USDT - 1â€™500â€™000 (4%)
- WETH - 250 (3%)
- WBTC - 2 (2.5%)
- GNO - 5â€™000 (2%)

âœ… Implemented (in series of txs): April 11, 2022

## Add Bridge Validator & Increase Requires Sigs

ðŸ—³ Justification: Incentivize users to move operations to the Gnosis Chain

âœ… Implemented: January 17, 2022

## Adjust Perpetual Finance contract auto-execution functionality

ðŸ—³ Justification: Perpetual Finance is no longer subsidizing transaction for users - users will need to deposit/withdraw/ and pay tx fees themselves. The bridge no longer needs to auto-execute transactions for this contract.

âœ… Implemented: December 22, 2021

## Decrease OmniBridge withdrawal fee for WETH

ðŸ—³ Justification: Incentivize users to move operations to the Gnosis Chain

âœ… Implemented: December 03, 2021

## Add Tornado cash contracts to Omnibridge forwarding rules manager

ðŸ—³ Justification: Add Tornado Cash contracts for proper routing and subsidized exits. This was done in several transactions from Oct 27 to Dec 10 to account for all contract functionality.

âœ… Implemented: October 27, November 9, November 15, 2021, December 10, 2021

## Increase finalization time to 20 blocks

## Increase finalization time on Ethereum Mainnet

ðŸ—³ Justification:  
Increase the amount of blocks required for confirmation on the Ethereum Mainnet to 20, increaseing bridge operation reliability and security (less chances for re-orgs). This update slightly delays user transfers from 2.5 minutes to \~4 minutes.

âœ… Implemented: August 20, 2021

## Reduce USDC withdrawal fees to 0 for 3 months

ðŸ—³ Justification: Current exit fees for USDC transfers on OmniBridge are currently 0.1%. The primary purpose of this temporary 3-month reduction to 0 fees is to attract more protocols utilizing USDC and OmniBridge for their activities.

âœ… Implemented: June 15, 2021

## Return user funds

ðŸ—³ Justification: A user accidentally [sent over 2000 USDC](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tx/0x2837cd89972f2e37a1cb631e60dbb761213010fe526a089c99f48ed483f63956) to the USDC token contract on Gnosis.
