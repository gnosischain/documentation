## Bridges Conceptual Architecture

Gnosis has three main types of bridges:

- **Native Bridge**: built into the chain itself, and mint the xDAI and ERC20 tokens from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain
- **3rd-party Bridges**: these are maintained by 3rd parties and allow users to swap for canonical tokens created by native bridges
- **Application-Specific Bridges**: some applications may provide custom bridges that maintain their own canonical token on Gnosis

## Gnosis Chain Bridge

Gnosis Chain bridge :
- allows minting the native stablecoin xDAI on gnosis chain by bridging DAI from Ethereum
- allows to bridge ERC20 token from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain


### Bridging Data

See the [Arbitrary Message Passing Bridge](../About%20Token%20Bridges/amb-bridge.md) or AMB Bridge for short.


## Roadmap

Gnosis has a [long-term roadmap](../roadmap.md) to move towards trustless bridges, and is actively funding research and development in this area.

## Feedback & Suggestion

We would love to hear from you on suggestions and ideas on bridges in Gnosis Chain.
