# Overview

Welcome to Gnosis Bridge! ðŸŽ‰ This documentation is the home to all things bridges and will guide you to interact with the Gnosis Bridge Explorer.

# Bridge Explorer

Bridge explorer allows user to check bridge transactions of xDAI bridge and Omnibridge, bridges configurations, and validators status. Users may also claim their bridge transactions in bridge explorer.

## Transactions

### How to search for your transation?

1. Select **xDAI** for [xDAI bridge](./tokenbridge/xdai-bridge.md) transaction or **Omnibridge** for [Omnibridge](./tokenbridge/omnibridge.md) transaction.
2. Search the transaction by inserting the transaction hash or initiator/receiver address.
3. You can use different filter options to filter out the unrelevant transactions.
4. Click on the transaction item to check the details of the transaction.

### What does different filters mean?

**Status**

1. Initiated: Transaction is initiated from the source chain.
2. Collecting: Signatures from validators are being collecting for the transaction.
3. Unclaimed: Transaction has collected enough signatures, but has not yet been claimed on Ethereum.
4. Completed: Transaction has been bridged successfully.
5. Error: Transaction is not bridged successfully.

**Direction**

1. Gnosis > Mainnet: The transaction is initiated from Gnosis Chain, and bridged to Ethereum mainnet, user need to claim the transaction on Ethereum mainnet.
2. Mainnet > Gnosis: The transaction is initiated from Ethereum mainnet, and bridged to Gnossi Chain.

**Signed by**

- The transaction is signed by which validator (validator calls `submitSignatures` to sign the transaction).

**Executed by**

- The transaction is executed by which validator (validator calls `executeAffirmation` to execute the transaction).

### How to claim your transaction

1. Click **Connect** button on top right corner and connect your wallet.
2. Search for your transaction
3. Click **Claim** button to claim your transaction.

   - Gnosis Chain -> Ethereum: Maximum amount of XDAI/token that users can bridge from Gnosis to Ethereum in a day.
2. **Execution Daily Limit**
   - Ethereum -> Gnosis Chain: Maximum amount of DAI/token that bridge validators can execute and bridge from Gnosis to Ethereum in a day.
   - Gnosis Chain -> Ethereum: Maximum amount of XDAI/token that bridge validators can execute and bridge from Ethereum to Gnosis in a day.
3. **Min. per transaction**: Minimum amount of token that users can bridge in a single transaction.
4. **Max. per transaction**: Maximum amount of DAI that users can bridge in a single transaction.
5. **Execution max. per transaction**: Maximum amount of token that validators can execute in a single transaction.
6. **Daily limit reset**: In how many hours will the daily limit get reset to zero.

If you are not coming from Ethereum, you can use one of the following bridges:
- [Jumper](https://jumper.exchange/) (by Li.Fi)
- [Bungee](https://www.bungee.exchange)
- [Hop](https://app.hop.exchange/)
- [Connext Bridge](https://bridge.connext.network/)

Gnosis' native bridges allow for sending tokens and data, and are run by a group of [trusted bridge validators](/bridges/tokenbridge/amb-bridge#bridge-validators). There is a [roadmap](/bridges/roadmap) to move towards [trustless bridges](/bridges/roadmap#trustless-bridges).

Gnosis' native bridges are first-class citizens in the chain's architecture due to the [native xDai bridge's](/bridges/tokenbridge/xdai-bridge) integral role in minting and burning the native [xDai token](/concepts/tokens/xdai) used for gas.
