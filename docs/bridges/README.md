Gnosis' native bridges allow for sending tokens and data, and are run by a group of [trusted bridge validators](/bridges/tokenbridge/amb-bridge#bridge-validators). There is a [roadmap](/bridges/roadmap) to move towards [trustless bridges](/bridges/roadmap#trustless-bridges).

Gnosis' native bridges are first-class citizens in the chain's architecture due to the [native xDai bridge's](/bridges/tokenbridge/xdai-bridge) integral role in minting and burning the native [xDai token](/concepts/tokens/xdai) used for gas.
