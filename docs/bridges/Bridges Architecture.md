## Conceptual Architecture

Gnosis has three main types of bridges:

- **Native Bridges**: built into the chain itself, and mint the [canonical token](./tokenbridge/omnibridge.md#canonical-token-registries) representation of the original asset on Gnosis (e.g. "Canonical Dai", "Canonical ETH")
- **3rd-party Bridges**: these are maintained by 3rd parties and allow users to swap for canonical tokens created by native bridges
- **Application-Specific Bridges**: some applications may provide custom bridges that maintain their own canonical token on Gnosis

## Native Bridges

Gnosis has two native bridges:

- **xDai Bridge** that is used to mint the native stablecoin by bridging Dai from Ethereum
- **Omnibridge** and underlying **Arbitrary Message Bridge** that are used for bridging tokens and data

### Bridging Dai

See the [xDai Bridge](/bridges/tokenbridge/xdai-bridge).

### Bridging Data

See the [Arbitrary Message Passing Bridge](/bridges/tokenbridge/amb-bridge) or AMB Bridge for short.

### Bridging Tokens

See the [Omnibridge](/bridges/tokenbridge/omnibridge), which is built on top of the [Arbitrary Message Passing Bridge](/bridges/tokenbridge/amb-bridge).

## Canonical Bridged Tokens

Tokens that are bridged using [Omnibridge](/bridges/tokenbridge/omnibridge) are regarded as canonical representations of the origin token on Gnosis Chain.

- Select the origin chain by using **Filter** option.

## Roadmap

Gnosis has a [long-term roadmap](/bridges/roadmap) to move towards trustless bridges, and is actively funding research and development in this area.

## Feedback & Suggestion

We would love to hear from you on suggestions and ideas on bridges in Gnosis Chain.
