### xDai &lt;-&gt; Eth Arbitrary Message Bridge deployment guide


Deployment instructions were released for contracts on the Ethereum to xDai Arbitrary Message Bridge. The guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying contracts and creating bridgeable ERC20 (or ERC677/829) tokens. The scripts create an equivalent ERC677 on xDai, along with all the necessary functionality so that existing tokens on Ethereum can be bridged and used on xDai.

Use-cases for bridged tokens may include a DEX on xDai, or many other features that take advantage of low cost and high speed transactions.
