### ✅ **xMoon Videos**

To use some of the awesome DApps incorporating Reddit MOONs on xDai (xMOONs), you need to transfer them to the xDai chain. These videos show you how to 1) transfer from your Reddit Vault to MetaMask and 2) **** Move MOONs from the Rinkeby testnet to xDai.  Once you have xMOONs, you can exchange them for xDai or even HNY using the uniswap fork deployed by 1Hive.
