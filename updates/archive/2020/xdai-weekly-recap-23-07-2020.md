### ✅ Foundation and Advisor Token Releases: Foundation pledges 100% of token release until end of year to EasyStaking

Tokens were released successfully for Advisors and Foundation as described in the token release schedule.

### ✅ Unit Protocol

Unit Protocol is a new decentralized borrowing protocol designed to provide a lot of flexibility for users. When it goes live, borrowers can use a wide range of coins and tokens as collateral for stable loans. In their whitepaper, the primary use case describes using $STAKE as an underlying collateral. We will follow the protocol as it develops.
