### ‚úÖ EasyStaking Coming in August

We are finishing up our audit with Quantstamp and implementing a shiny new UI for the August launch of EasyStaking. Stay tuned for details!

### ‚úÖ 1st KickBack Event on xDai

The first official Kickback event successfully launched on xDai. Kickback is an RSVP and ticketing platform and it has deployed to xDai to avoid the large gas fees on Ethereum. Signup and event creation are easy, intuitive experiences, and a great way to host a virtual event with some accountability and potential rewards for participants and event organizers.

Events can be related to anything (crypto & non-crypto alike), but participants commit and receive rewards in xDai. This is a great onboarding to tool with real-world applications which introduces users to the power of xDai.
