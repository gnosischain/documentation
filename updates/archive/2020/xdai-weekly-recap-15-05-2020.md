# ⚔️ xDai Weekly Recap - 15/05/2020

## ✅ **STAKE on 1inch.exchange**

STAKE is now available for trading on 1inch.exchange. 1inch is a DEX aggregator, as more DEXs add STAKE (currently UniSwap is the first STAKE DEX) you can use 1inch to find the best rates and even split trades across multiple DEXs.
