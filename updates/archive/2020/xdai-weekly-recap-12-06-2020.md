### ✅ EasyStaking ongoing development

We continue to refine our model for easy staking. This will provide a second staking option for users with STAKE on the Ethereum Mainnet and a way to incorporate staking into 3rd party applications. In addition, we are researching ways to provide STAKE rewards for Liquidity Pools on Uniswap and other advanced incentives.  The EasyStaking UI is also undergoing improvements including:

* A simple and intuitive user interface
* Dynamic display continually updates your STAKE rewards
* Built-in staking calculator
