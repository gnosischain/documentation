### ✅ **Liquidity pool added to Balancer**

Balancer is a decentralized token exchange and pool manager, and liquidity pools can be created with varying percentages of tokens (ie pools do not need to be split 50/50 like in Uniswap, but can contain different percentages like this pool which is 90% STAKE / 10% WETH).
