## ‚úÖ **TokenBridge Grant Award**

The TokenBridge project, which powers xDai interoperability (for both Dai -> xDai and STAKE) received funding support from the **Ethereum Ecosystem Support Program**. While not directly related to xDai, this grant will help support new features and enhanced functionality for the bridge that will directly impact the xDai chain.
