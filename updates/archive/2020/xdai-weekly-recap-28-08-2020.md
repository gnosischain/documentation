### ✅ SpankChain Validator and Migration

Ameen on xDai: "I’m putting my money where my mouth is, so I recently bought 20K+ STAKE on behalf of SpankChain, and another 20K on behalf of MetaCartel Ventures so both orgs can stake on xDAI by running validator nodes and help secure the network. I’m also excited to announce that SpankChain will be relocating the [SpankBank](https://bank.spankchain.com/) to xDAI in the coming week"
