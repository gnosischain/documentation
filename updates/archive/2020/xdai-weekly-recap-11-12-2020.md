## :fuelpump: 1,000,000,000,000+ Gas Consumption Milestone

The xDai chain hit over 1 Trillion total gas consumed since network inception! This number has grown steadily over time starting with events like EthDenver and the Splunk Conference with massive recent spikes due to applications like Dark Forest and Circles UBI leveraging xDai to support resource-intensive apps.
