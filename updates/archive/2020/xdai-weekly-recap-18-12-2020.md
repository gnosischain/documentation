## POSDAO Staking Updates

We are very excited to be closing in on the public launch of staking and delegation on xDai. We are completing our final rounds of testing and have been releasing videos on how to complete basic processes such as bridging STAKE, delegating STAKE, and claiming rewards.

See the Become a Delegator section for a basic overview, and the Staking Operations section for details on using the Staking DApp.

We've also drafted an example reward scenario which compares potential staking rewards for EasyStaking, LP Providers, POSDAO delegators and POSDAO validators.

## :construction\_worker: BlockScout Smart Contract Verification

BlockScout added a new feature with devs in mind to the xDai block explorer instance. Now smart contracts can be verified in 2 ways. It is still possible to use a flattener, but the new method is designed for ease of verification. Devs can simply upload all contract source files and JSON metadata, and the contract can be verified. This feature leverages [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/), and makes verification easier than ever.

## Twitter Update

The xDai Chain official Twitter account was suspended for unknown reasons on Tuesday, December 15.  We have contacted Twitter and have not heard anything back from their team regarding reasons for the suspension or steps for remediation.  They are reporting delays for reviews and responses of accounts at the moment. We hope to hear back from them soon.
