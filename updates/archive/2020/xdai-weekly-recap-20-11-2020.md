# ‚öîÔ∏è xDai Weekly Recap - 20/11/2020

import ArchiveWarning from '@site/src/components/ArchiveWarning';

<ArchiveWarning />

This week we highlight several crowd-sourced funding platforms on xDai. The blockchain community is rallying around projects and building infrastructure from the ground up. Matching funds are helping smaller projects and developers realize a decentralized future!

Note that we will skip several weekly updates over the holiday season. **We will not publish a weekly update next week: November 21 - 28.**

## :moneybag: Ecosystem Funding

### ‚úì Buidl Guidl

Austin Griffith's latest project aims to connect funders and developers through a quadratic funding mechanism. This provides signals about what funders want in rapid rounds, and devs can then rapidly iterate on experimental projects designed to support the entire Ethereum Ecosystem. Funding is on Ethereum, at [https://support.buidlguidl.com/](https://support.buidlguidl.com/) and bounties are on xDai. Many xDai-centric projects are available to fund.

### ‚úì clr.fund

[clr.fund](http://clr.fund/#/) provides permissionless quadratic funding to Ethereum projects. After a successful first run, clr.fund Round 1 introduces [BrightID](https://www.brightid.org/) for Sybil resistance and mid-round sign ups for contributors.  This round \~$1,000 of matching funds were provided by STAKEhaus (a moloch DAO on xDai sponsored by RaidGuild and xDAI).
