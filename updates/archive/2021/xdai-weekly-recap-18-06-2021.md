## Bridge Governance

The bridge governance board is composed of 13 members who are responsible for managing bridge operations on both sides of the bridge (contracts are deployed on the Ethereum and xDai side). 7/13 signatures are required to approve any management proposal.

A new summary page shows updates and decisions from the bridge board of governors. The most recent measure passed by the board reduced USDC withdrawal fees to 0 for 3 months.
