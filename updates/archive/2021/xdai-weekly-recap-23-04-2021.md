### :telephone: xDai Community Call

We held a community call on discord primarily focused on future directions for xDai and improving governance processes for researchers interested in exploring the xDai future. An interesting area of research is related to rollups, and a working group was formed in Discord to research what it might take to incorporate with Ethereum 2.0.
