## POSDAO & Protocol Updates

:::success
The protocol is currently in Epoch **65.**\
****\
****There are **16** validator pools with **355 delegators** staking a total of **657,721 STAKE.**

One validator pool [became inactive](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/inactive-pools) after the node was down for more than 4 consecutive days. Delegators to this pool should move STAKE to other active pools to continue earning rewards for protocol protection.\
\
High pool APY is currently **17.78%**, low is **2.39%** _(stats as of 15/07/2021 15:00)_.
