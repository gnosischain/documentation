### :map: Ecosystem Fund Roadmap

The xDai ecosystem unlocks will begin soon, and this will provide partner funding, additional bug bounties, a 1M grants program, and additional liquidity for xDai DEXs. The roadmap provides information about how the Ecosystem is planning to use these funds to increase adoption and usage. We will continue to add items as they arise.

### :fox: MetaMask icon added to BlockScout and Omnibridge

The new icon is designed to make it easy to add new bridged tokens to your xDai wallet. When bridging, it appear in the OmniBridge interface, and is also available in BlockScout for any bridged token. The easiest way to access a list of bridged tokens is from the Tokens Dropdown.

## :butterfly: Project News & Updates

### xDai collaborates with Immunefi to offer $2 Million Bug Bounty for Bridge.

**This is the largest know bug bounty currently in the Defi Space!** As xDai usage continues to grow, security of user funds is our number one priority. Immunify is leading the way in the white hat space, and this collaboration sets a new standard for security. We plan to offer additional bounties for our other applications to provide xDai users piece of mind with the xDai protocol.
