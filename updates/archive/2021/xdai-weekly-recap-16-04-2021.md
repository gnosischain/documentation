## 🌉 BSC OmniBridge Feature Update

Moving assets between bridges can be difficult if you don't have native assets. The latest upgrade to the BSC bridge lets users send wrapped BNB to the Binance Smart Chain from xDai and receive BNB directly on BSC. Users can then use the native BNB to pay for txs and process additional bridge transfers between chains.
