## ‚úç STAKE Proposals

Several proposals are currently circulating regarding the STAKE token.

### Maker Application

Voting is ongoing to add STAKE as a Dai collateral. If the community votes to Greenlight STAKE, domain teams prioritize assessments of token risk, contracts and other variables to determine inclusion parameters.

## ü¶ã Project Updates

Upcoming Project Migrations, current project announcements and new projects on xDai.

### BAO

* We are going to have 2 Bao Farmer contracts, one on Ethereum mainnet and on the xDAI network (an Ethereum L2 sidechain).
* The new xDAI chain contract will issue $BAO.CX (Bao Coupon XDAI) which will be redeemable 1:1 for Bao tokens on the main Ethereum chain.
* Users will be able to pick to farm in either contract. Using the xDAI chain is simple and requires them to move their tokens via a bridge contract.
