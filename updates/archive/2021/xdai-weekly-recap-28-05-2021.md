## :pencil2: Protocol Updates

### Prior Pending Claims Amnesty

Assets worth more than 360K were sent to users on Ethereum from prior pending claims from the xDaiBridge and the Omnibridge. These assets consisted of pending claims where users had not completed the process on mainnet. Many had been in the contract for months. The funds were released from the bridge contracts and the xDai team paid the tx fees totaling 9.65 ETH for over 1000 transactions. This was a one-time event with no immediate plans for future amnesty.

**xDai Bridge**

* Amount: 160K DAI
* Addresses: 461
* Tx Fees: 3.58 ETH
* USD equivalent: $8,985.00
* USD cost avg per tx: $19.50

**OmniBridge**

* Amount: 200K+ USD value
* Addresses: 570
* Tx Fees: 6.06 ETH
* USD equivalent: $15,200.00
* USD cost avg per tx: $26.66

### OmniBridge AutoFaucet

To assist new user onboarding, and automatic faucet feature was added to the [OmniBridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge). Users moving assets over the Omnibridge from Ethereum or BSC to xDai now also automatically receive $.01 xDai\* in addition to their bridged asset. This can be used to process transactions and swap some of their remaining assets into xDai as required. Over [500 faucet transactions](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x562a9171c251777766285E877c80e7F4cC02d165/transactions) have been processed since this feature was implemented on May 22.

_\*Only non-contract wallets with a 0 xDai balance receive xDai._

## üìä Network Statistics

### New Monthly ATH for Txs

xDai continues to see month-over-month usage and transactional growth. 6.3M transactions have been processed in the past 30 days. Source: [https://duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xDai-Usage](https://duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xDai-Usage)

### Gas Usage per Day

A new metric was added to measure gas use percentage. Gas usage is often a more telling metric than txs per day, as it captures the total use for all types of transactions, including resource intensive ones (some complex contract transactions can exceed 7M gas for 1 tx for example). Several high resource transactions can fill an entire block.

### Staking on xDai

Over 600K STAKE is now protecting the protocol on xDai, over 75% of STAKE supply available on the network. Source: [https://duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xdai-staking](https://duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xdai-staking)
