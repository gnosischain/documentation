### EOA views added to xDai Usage Dashboard

Externally owned accounts on xDai represent a fair amount of volume, especially when related to account activity and overall transactions. We added this metric to see how EOAs are using xDai in relation to larger project utilization of the chain. The usage dashboard is available at [https://duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xDai-Usage](https://duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xDai-Usage)

### Ethers.js Quick Start Guide

Ethers.js is a useful javascript library available to developers. It is much smaller than [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/) and easy-to-use for new developers, and we created a simple guide for devs.

## :butterfly: Project Updates

### :satellite: Dark Forest Round 1 Completed

Dark Forest Round 1 was a big success on xDai, accounting for a big increase in transactions, usage and users. Get ready, round 2 starts shortly!

### :house\_with\_garden: RealT Real Estate

RealT tokenized real estate continues to sell quickly. In a volatile market environment real-world assets with more predictable yields (and predictable pricing on xDai) provide some much needed balance!

### Minerva Streaming Farms

Another innovation from the Minerva team -  NFTs that come with a MIVA stream attached, once the user has deposited LP tokens from Honeyswap.
