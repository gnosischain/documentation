# ⚔️ xDai Weekly Recap - 29/01/2021

## POSDAO & Protocol Updates

:::success
Epoch **42** has started, with **15** validator pools and **149** delegators staking a total of **447,425** STAKE _(as of 29/01/2021 16:50 UTC)_.
:::

Updated staking statistics for POSDAO on xDai & EasyStaking on Ethereum are available on the Dune Analytics Dashboard at [https://duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xdai-staking](https://duneanalytics.com/maxaleks/xdai-staking)

We are working to display additional statistics around expected APY for delegators within the staking application on BlockScout with plans to publish next week. Staking rewards vary based on several factors including the current quality of a validator's work (number of block skips) as well as the number of delegators in a pool. This display will help inform delegators when deciding which pools to stake into.

* **Pool Rewards**: Based on number of blocks produced relative to other validators in the set during a staking epoch
* **Delegator Rewards**: Vary based on how many delegators are in a pool and how many tokens a delegator has staked relative to other pool delegators.

### Using STAKE in a Gnosis Safe for Governance

The Snapshot protocol is setup for voting by address rather than multi-sig contracts. However, with the help of WalletConnect, users can delegate STAKE stored in a Gnosis Safe on Ethereum to an address which can then vote on xDai proposals.
