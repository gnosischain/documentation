## Prototol News

### :green\_heart: Green NFTs on xDai

We published an article on the amount of energy projects can save by moving NFT operations to xDai. The results are :eyes: opening! Leaders in the space such as the Crypto stamp project from the Austrian Post are looking for alternatives and finding xDai is a natural fit.

### :calendar\_spiral: Daily Active Accounts

Active accounts on xDai have show huge gains this week, driven by the new Swarm integration. In an informative tweet, Igor Barinov reported on this increase along with some insightful comparisons to the Polygon ecosystem for context.

### :man\_raising\_hand: BootNode Validator Application

BootNode is a relatively new company, but the founder Manual has a long history of supporting xDai. Previously he was the C\*O at Protofire and one of the original 4 validators on the xDai chain. The BootNode application highlights the new team and the additional decentralization they will bring. "BootNode aims to bootstrap a self-sustainable, production-grade network and bridge validator." 

The proposal is now open for any comments, and a snapshot vote will follow in the coming week.
