### Nethermind

* Prepared some monitoring stack for the Chiado hard fork

* New release for the Sepolia / Chiado issue: v1.31.4


### Erigon

  * Same release for Chiado


### Geth
* Not present

### Reth

* Pushed Pectra related changes for Chiado

## CL

## Pectra
* Sepolia issue
  * Reproduced on devnet 2 and would appear on Chiado as well
  * The chain would still be progressing but with empty blocks as long as the buggy transaction stays in the mempool
  * We need to upgrade all the Chiado nodes

## Research
* Testing
  * We should test important contract upgrades (namely the deposit contract) in a shadow fork. Had we not caught the issue on Sepolia, we would have instantly broken the chain with a very basic `setImplementation` call on the deposit contract.
