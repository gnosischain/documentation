## CL

## Pectra
* Devnet
  * -[SOLVED] consolidation doesn't work (high priority)

  * -[Deployed for gnosis_mainnet, not sure about Chiado] deploy 7002/7251/6110 contracts
  * -[SOLVED] devnet-5 issue
    * Most likely a mismatch in the versions (Erigon was using Devnet 6 configs, Nethermind Devnet 5)
    * Anders from Nethermind is still looking into it
    * Not reproducible on Devnet 6, but was reproduced on Devnet 5

    * Might not be Gnosis-specific
