### Geth

* Working on the rebase to 1.15.6 which has a bad issue that affects archive nodes (fixed in 1.15.7)
  * Rebase to .7 is not a huge priority because probably no one is running an archive node on GC
  * Still some issues on Chiado post-Pectra
    * Potentially linked to the fee collection contract

* Was trying to run a testnet on RISC-V
  * Geth is running
  * Wasnâ€™t able to compile any CL for that architecture though

* Second full-sync for Chiado with Pectra until tip is finalized
  * So no issues have been introduced with the latest changes
