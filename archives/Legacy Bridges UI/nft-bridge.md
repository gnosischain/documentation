# NFT Bridge

Gnosis does not support the native bridging of NFTs, which is usually done through [3rd-party NFT Bridges](../../about/third-parties.md) (e.g. [XP NFT Bridge](https://bridge.xp.network/))

There is a [legacy native NFT bridge](https://github.com/tokenbridge/docs/blob/master/eth-xdai-amb-bridge/nft-omnibridge-extension/README.md) that is no longer actively maintained.
