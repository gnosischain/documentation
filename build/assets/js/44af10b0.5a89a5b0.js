Going to look into this. New config variables for Teku (default ones) fixed the issue with newer version. No updates\\n\\n- **Erigon**: Erigon v3 is a fundamental rearchitecture for the data structures.Old state is read-only and can be stored on IPFS / torrent\\n  Caplin: New embedded CL, UX improvement. Can save on the disk footprint because you don\u2019t need to duplicate blocks between EL and CL\\n  Might also become a validator client.\\n\\n- **Geth**: Burner contract was missing. Rewards are still being figured out because the contract doesn\u2019t return anything despite a reward having to be paid. Wondering if there\u2019s an archive node for Guillaume. Ping Anna from Gateway on Telegram\\n\\n## CL\\n\\n- **Lighthouse** No updates.\\n\\n# Mainnet\\n\\nPreliminary audit done, waiting for formal approval.\\nDappnode packages done.\\nWe need new ones for Erigon and Nimbus.\\nSedge: right versions?\\nAvado, Stereum?\\n\\n# Hive Tests\\n\\nErigon still in progress\\nAdded transfer event checks\\nSeparated execution layer checks from protocol layer checks\\nThe dashboard works and is ready to be deployed\\nThe question is how this is going to fit into the workflow, where it\u2019s going to be hosted and who\u2019s going to manage it\\nWill be talked about with Marcos\\nLooking into adding more corner cases before the shapella hard fork\\n\\n# Chiado\\n\\nContract not upgraded yet, will be done today\\n\\n# Chain Infra\\n\\nGateway: Experiences some issues on Nethermind nodes when there\u2019s too many concurrent requests. Still investigating this. Will ping on Telegram\\n\\n# Research\\n\\nVerkle trees: On mainnet a billion nodes will have to be updated, which will be done in batches. On Gnosis Chain, as the blocks are faster, there\u2019s less work to calculate those batches. Gnosis Chain seems to have way less accounts: about 1 million according to Gnosisscan, does that seem correct?"},{"id":"/2023/07/05/core-devs-call","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/2023/07/05/core-devs-call","source":"@site/updates/2023/07-05-core-devs-call.md","title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/07/05","description":"Core Devs Call","date":"2023-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"CoreDevsCall","permalink":"/updates/tags/core-devs-call"},{"label":"gnosis","permalink":"/updates/tags/gnosis"}],"readingTime":1.835,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lion - dapplion","title":"Merge coordinator","url":"https://github.com/dapplion","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35266934","key":"dapplion"},{"name":"0xarmagan","title":"Validator Comms Lead @ Gnosis","url":"https://github.com/0xarmagan","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75987728","key":"armaganercan"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/07/05","authors":["dapplion","armaganercan"],"tags":["CoreDevsCall","gnosis"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/07/12","permalink":"/updates/2023/07/12/core-devs-call"},"nextItem":{"title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/06/28","permalink":"/updates/2023/06/28/core-devs-call"}},"content":"![Core Devs Call](https://github.com/gnosischain/documentation-1/assets/75987728/1b0c87c5-5e53-4bd5-ad4c-a540a2e14762)\\n\\nWelcome to the weekly Gnosis Core Devs Call, where members of the Gnosis team and contributors gather to discuss the latest developments and updates related to the Gnosis ecosystem.

Needs to be very clearly documented. Has the potential to break things. Explorers and Indexers (how are they extracting withdrawal information right now?)\\n\\n- The Graph\\n- Dune\\n\\n**Brainstorming**\\nWithdrawals are system transactions\\nPotential solutions: It\u2019s still technically possible to emit receipts, but they wouldn\u2019t be linked to a transaction. It\u2019s fine, but it could break some things. When syncing, we expect the number of receipts to be equal to the number of transactions, but in this case there would be transactions + 1 receipts. Could break JSON-RPC because of existing assumptions. Probably not the best way, but Lukasz doesn\u2019t see any other way.\\n\\nInside the node, when someone calls `eth_getLogs` we could add some artificial logs to GNO based on withdrawals. Would be very hacky. Only on the JSON-RPC level. Might be complicated because of some specific optimizations. Might not be related only to `eth_getLogs`, because with those logs you should be sure that the withdrawal was applied, which we can\u2019t necessarily do with Gnosis withdrawals. Could work fine without failing withdrawals. We could add a custom transaction that has a receipt for all the GNO transfer events. This would make blocks a bit more specific. Could make it more difficult for block builders. Some more specific code for Gnosis that is different from mainnet.\\n\\n# Testnet\\n\\nTimestamp\\nThe shapella hard fork caused the network to no longer accept contract deployments because of a bug in Nethermind related to EIP-3860 and EIP-170\\nWe fixed the network on May 26, 2023 by updating all Nethermind nodes\\nIt didn\u2019t require a hard fork, as it\u2019s the majority client on Chiado and technically didn\u2019t do anything \u201cwrong\u201d, i.e. didn\u2019t produce blocks that are invalid according to our spec\\n\\n# Hive\\n\\nTests for withdrawals\\nTesting that the balance is applied correctly to the address. Sending transactions and checking that they are performing ok. Checking the storage after withdrawals are applied.\\n\\nTesting sync\\nCreated blocks and transactions and connected other clients to test if they can sync.\\n\\nTested hard forks\\nNext step is to add Erigon to the tests"},{"id":"/2023/05/24/core-devs-call","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/2023/05/24/core-devs-call","source":"@site/updates/2023/05-24-core-devs-call.md","title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/05/24","description":"Core Devs Call May 24","date":"2023-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 24, 2023","tags":[{"label":"CoreDevsCall","permalink":"/updates/tags/core-devs-call"},{"label":"gnosis","permalink":"/updates/tags/gnosis"}],"readingTime":1.45,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lion - dapplion","title":"Merge coordinator","url":"https://github.com/dapplion","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35266934","key":"dapplion"},{"name":"0xarmagan","title":"Validator Comms Lead @ Gnosis","url":"https://github.com/0xarmagan","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75987728","key":"armaganercan"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/05/24","authors":["dapplion","armaganercan"],"tags":["CoreDevsCall","gnosis"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/05/31","permalink":"/updates/2023/05/31/core-devs-call"},"nextItem":{"title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/05/17","permalink":"/updates/2023/05/17/core-devs-call"}},"content":"![Core Devs Call May 24](https://github.com/gnosischain/documentation-1/assets/75987728/ba039953-d6db-4858-8668-9aed48169e97)\\n\\nWelcome to the weekly Gnosis Core Devs Call, where members of the Gnosis team and contributors gather to discuss the latest developments and updates related to the Gnosis ecosystem.

Maybe later today or tomorrow. Preparing a new major release. Found some issues, mostly optimizations and bug fixes. Probably going to be released next week. Will send the release notes once they have them\\n\\n- **Erigon**: New release (2.43) Replaced the light consensus client with a more experimental full consensus version. As it\u2019s a full blown CL implementation, it should also be able to work for Gnosis in the future`--externalcl` is now default (and the flag was removed).Use `--internalcl` now to use the new experimental CL. Looking to hire a new core developer. Gnosis HR has been helping. New diagnostic tool https://github.com/ledgerwatch/diagnostics.

A previous block by the same node has been accepted by the network. Except by the broken Erigon node. The failed block has a different state root and an additional withdrawal. This specific node rejected a block that was considered valid by all other nodes. We don\u2019t exactly know why the broken node rejected the valid block. There was an unwind right before on the broken node. Logs for both Erigon nodes are in the Telegram group\\n- Nethermind (5-6 Nethermind nodes, out of which 2 had issues)\\n- Lodestar: Seemingly peering issue\\n  Ping-pongs between having enough peers and not having enough, so it wasn\u2019t able to keep in sync\\n- Teku (although another one was working fine)\\n  Started sending FCUs of the same blocks over and over again around 1k blocks before it lost sync\\n  Might have been connected to Gateway\u2019s broken Erigon node\\n- Gnosis\\n  Experiencing issues as well (running Erigon, Nethermind, Teku and Lighthouse, 2.5k keys total).Nodes are stuck on different block numbers. Currently debugging more in depth. None of the 4 validator combinations are working correctly and are on different forks. Giacomo and Igor will keep in touch to debug this.\\n- Next steps\\n  - Find the issue (Andrew)\\n  - Launch a new devnet\\n    Alerts (Lion)\\n\\nThe objective is to track everything that can go bad and send alerts to the relevant parties. Has a private repo with a bunch of alerts. Covered basically everything on the consensus side. Will add the relevant people on the repo async. Will be set up by Gnosis DevOps, Giacomo knows about it already. Ruben tested failed withdrawals on Apr 4, 2023\\n\\nThe current implementation executes withdrawals transactions after standard transactions. This means that the event logs are missed. We might want to drop them, as they are thus useless. To track specific parameters we could add more variables. Erigon behaves in the same way. Instead of using events to check if a withdrawal was successful, we could check the state of the contract to see if the transaction was added to the failed transactions. If not, it should be considered successful\\nThis is not super accurate though and doesn\u2019t give great visibility.\\n\\nLion thinks it might be possible to do it with the current withdrawal contract implementation, but if not we can add some primitives.

It\u2019s a bigger task than anticipated\\n\\n# People\\n\\nNethermind agreed to take on DevOps and QA roles and is looking for people\\n\\n# Research\\n\\n- Home stakers affected by ISP bandwidth limitation (because of CL). Workaround?\\n\\nIdea: Reduce transaction pool size (EL)\\nSeveral members of community receiving letters from ISP saying their service will be cancelled due to high bandwidth consumption\\n\\n### Past Research\\n\\n- Research: 5s Blocktimes for Gnosis\\n\\nThere would be an advantage of having 4 or 6s block times to be in sync with Ethereum. Connected block builders could be used to have optimistic mechanisms in contracts for cross-chain arbitrage.\\n\\n- Also requires Genesis times to be aligned\\n\\nGnosis Dec-08-2021 07:55:40 PM\\nEthereum Dec-01-2020 12:00:23 PM\\nMeaning that have one block time be a multiple of the other one would probably still not work either way\\n\\n# xDAI as base fee\\n\\nNothing actionable right now. The last weekend showed the problem. Gnosis wants to be decentralized and resilient. The base token (DAI) is essentially wrapped USD bank deposits at this point. Mostly USDC (60-70%). DAI is very affected by potential US banking problems.\\n\\n- Problematic for credible neutrality\\n\\nProblematic because it\u2019s linked to a specific \u201cregion\u201d (i.e. the USA)\\nMoving to GNO as a base token\\n\\nThe idea of a stable coin as a base token is nice and many like it based on an internal poll. How bad is it actually if DAI has an issue?\\n\\nHaving fees be twice cheaper is not a huge issue, as in any case there\u2019s still an auction for block space\\nDAI is not integral to the security of the chain, whatever its price.\\n\\nIt still impacts all the users that are forced to hold DAI because of Gnosis.\\n\\nIt would impact a lot of DeFi as well\\nUsing a less centralized stable instead of GNO would be a nice option.\\n\\nThere\u2019s some very early research. We could schedule an open research call.\\n\\n- Option: fork Maker on Gnosis\\n\\nIn the same way that Maker accepts 1 USDC as collateral to get 1 DAI, we could start with that and then add options to add GNO or other crypto assets as collateral. Gives a lot more flexibility. We can limit the amount of xDAI minted through DAI and force more of it to be minted through decentralized collateral\\n\\n- Thought Experiment: GNO as a Native Token\\n\\nSome ideas (lacking expertise)\\nDifferent opcodes for \\"legacy\\" native asset transfers vs. GNO transfers\\nDifferent txn types (e.g. type 1, EIP-1559, and GNO-native txns)\\nUtilizing legacy RPC URLs to relay txns using a JIT airdrop of GNO\\n\\n# Misc\\n\\nFigure out deploy strategy on Chiado so that we can replicate it on Mainnet\\nI.e. go through the same deposit contract upgrades etc"},{"id":"/2023/03/08/core-devs-call","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/2023/03/08/core-devs-call","source":"@site/updates/2023/03-08-core-devs-call.md","title":"Core Devs Call - 2023/03/08","description":"Greetings everyone, and welcome to the weekly Gnosis Core Devs Call.

The current devnet is mostly internal for Nethermind\\n  It has a very low amount of validators. For a public one we should create a new devnet. Maybe we can still open it at least to Erigon so they can start testing\\n  Infra (explorers etc) are already mostly set up\\n  Lion is suggesting to use Nimbus\u2019 explorer (which is way more minimal) in case beaconcha.in can\u2019t keep up\\n  The withdrawal address contract isn\u2019t known in advance, which is a bit problematic. Ideally we should have `create2` deployments so that the address is known in advance\\n  The address should be identical across deployments to make things easier\\n- Needs to be deployed with the same EOA. Ruben will try to get this to work\\n- New larger devnet: We\u2019ll give one week of notice to allow everyone to spin up infra\\n\\n# Tests\\n\\n- Hive\\n  Max brought in by Anna. He\u2019s working with the Gateway team and moved to Erigon. Worked on the Hive tests to figure out the differences between Ethereum and Gnosis\\n  Crafted a new genesis for Gnosis.

Should have some 0x01 addresses\\n  - Method 1: Jorge\u2019s \u201cMerge\u201d method of just overwriting storage slots\\n  - Nethermind and Erigon have support for storage allocations\\n  - Makes it possible to give tokens to users in contracts\\n  -

Withdrawals have not been tested yet\\n      - Figuring BLS addresses out\\n      - The nodes are public, so an RPC can be shared\\n      - Erigon can also join this devnet, but the mock contract is still used, so that needs to be configured\u200d\\n  - Erigon\u200d\\n    - Not implemented yet\\n    - Can be done this week\\n  - General\\n    - We can spin up a devnet with both clients end of next week (March 2nd)\\n  - Gnosis DevOps\\n    - Will run Nethermind first?\\n\\n## Client team updates\\n\\n### Execution Layer\\n\\n- Nethermind\u200d\\n  -

Marek agrees because Ethereum also supports Hive tests\\n  - However, the initial effort will be more important as we have nothing yet\\n\\n### POSDAO\\n\\n- Currently: Truffle test suites\\n- Really annoying to work with\\n- Still-relevant\\n  - Deprecated, but still necessary for nodes being synced from Genesis:\\n    - Pre-merge testing of POSDAO - rotation of validator set, voting etc\\n    - Test that we can still go thru the Merge without going thru forks or nodes getting start\\n  - Still relevant:\\n    - xDai Block Rewards\\n    - Has prevented really bad problems from happening\\n      - Syncing from Genesis\\n\\n### None of them are being worked on\\n\\n- Would anyone have capacity to do either?\\n  - Nethermind: Hive tests are written in Go\\n    - Nethermind has devs, but not sure anyone is available\\n  - Erigon: Andrew will ask around, but probably no capacity\\n- Would be great to have long term ownership of Gnosis tests\\n  - Especially for shutterized beacon chain etc in the future\\n- We wouldn\u2019t need a suite as extensive as Ethereum\u2019s for now\\n  - The withdrawal tests are relatively succinct\\n\\n### Miscellaneous\\n\\n- The xDai team did an attempt at implementing withdrawals\\n  - https://hackmd.io/@k1rill-fedoseev/SkS0ua5mq#Capella\\n  - They had a way to pause withdrawals\\n    - Sounds really bad, we don\u2019t want to be able to stop the network\\n- There will be no trace (logs) of withdrawals on explorers\\n  - We need to work with explorers to display them\\n  - Ideally they add a new tab, similar to \u201cinternal\u201d / \u201cERC-20\u201d for withdrawals\\n  - We can probably piggy-back from the mainnet implementation\\n  - Caveat: insolvency case, might require some specific logic\\n  - Beaconcha.in\\n  - Gnosisscan\\n  - Blockscout\\n- Lukasz: should withdrawals be shown in traces somewhere?\\n  - Lukasz: mixed feelings\\n  - We should maybe ask block explorers / users what they want?\\n  - Dapplion: let\u2019s keep it simple"},{"id":"/2023/02/15/core-devs-call","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/2023/02/15/core-devs-call","source":"@site/updates/2023/02-15-core-devs-call.md","title":"Core Devs Call -

[Discord invite link](https://discord.gg/mPJ9zkq)\\n- [AMA on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLHqA495rvY)\\n\\nRepresentatives from xDai (Igor Barinov) and Gnosis (Stefan George) answered questions about the proposed merger.  Questions were also collected throughout the past week and some are listed below. Questions below the AMA video give some additional context and see responses to popular questions that may not have been raised during the call.\\n\\n[The proposal is available here for reference](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904).\\n\\n### Questions from the Community\\n\\nWe include some questions and answers here from the initial form sent out to the community. Some questions were redundant and not included, or edited for clarity. We will update with the recording and other relevant questions after the AMA.\\n\\n### 1. What motivated the developers to propose this?\\n\\nBoth teams have worked together for some time, and looking ahead there are some big changes coming to Ethereum and associated scaling solutions. To come from a position of strength, it makes sense to combine forces and consolidate resources when two conditions are met:\\n\\n1. The teams share the same values in building technically excellent products in the spirit of open innovation. Both Gnosis and xDai are committed to fostering network effects without locking users in. Both Gnosis and xDai champion self-sovereign network participants.\\n2. The technology stacks being developed by both teams compliment each other and together provide a comprehensive scaling solution for users.\\n\\n### 2. Are the holdings of the developers in GNO and STAKE made public?\\n\\nThe initial STAKE distribution for the xDai team and investors is available here.  These tokens have mostly been distributed and team holdings besides the distributions remaining to the ecosystem fund have been dispersed.\\n\\nA partnership [announced between the teams last year](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-protocol-and-xdai-partnership-1de0e48fb14b) resulted a Gnosis investment in xDai for 250K STAKE.\\n\\nBeyond these distributions STAKE tokens are held by the greater community and all trades are transparent on BlockScout & Etherscan. The following includes contracts holding STAKE as well as EOAs.\\n\\n* [STAKE holders on xDai](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0xb7D311E2Eb55F2f68a9440da38e7989210b9A05e/token-holders)\\n* [Stake on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0Ae055097C6d159879521C384F1D2123D1f195e6#balances)\\n\\n### 3. While Gnosis is planning to split the governance power of GNO into COW and SAFE for their other products, do you think it is reasonable to proceed with the merger based on the current value of GNO (which actually includes the governance value of their products that will likely have a separate governance token)? Why not wait for their token splits from GNO?\\n\\nGnosis holders will benefit significantly from the launch of the COW and SAFE tokens, both directly via an airdrop and a much coveted investment opportunity into the projects. The value of GNO is additionally backed by 700M in crypto assets (excluding GNO) that are in the process of being move to the DAO (and under the direct control of the GNO token holders)\\n\\n#### Related: Assuming GNO stops having flagship products such as Safe and Cowswap under its control why should the current value of GNO be relevant at the time of the merge when it is currently still bundling the governance control of these products?\\n\\n1. GNO holders will benefit directly from the token launches of the spin-off projects.\\n2. GNO holders control a very significant treasury (USD 700M in ETH and other tokens, excluding GNO).\\n\\n### 4. What changes will be made to the GNO issuance policy and distribution methodology?\\n\\n400k GNO held by the DAO (currently \\\\~190m USD) will be used to incentivize adoption of Gnosis Chain. The DAO (i.e. all current GNO holders) holds 8m GNO. It is likely that the DAO will decide to burn some of these tokens.\\n\\n### 5. How can the merge benefit the xDai community with respect to the STAKE holders?\\n\\nIn the event of a merge, STAKE holders will become GNO holders and retain the ability to voice opinions and steer directions for the chain. STAKE holders will hold 20% of the GNO in circulation at the proposed token merge rate. The idea is that combining forces of these 2 projects will result in a stronger and more complete entity, with the hope that the market would acknowledge this and the Gnosis Chain & GNO would benefit accordingly.\\n\\n### 6. How will the chain be secured? If only 1 Gno is req for running a node, the price of Gno needs to have a big upside or the chain can be easy overtaken by others? How will it be decentralized?\\n\\nThere will be many more validators with the beacon chain, along with random validator shuffling to prevent attacks and collusion. This is a good resource to understand how the validator and proposer functionality works and what to expect with the beacon chain (this is for the ETH Beacon chain but methods will work similarly on the mirrored beacon-chain [https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/](https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/). The chain has the potential to be much more decentralized as many more regular users around the world can participate with a lower economic barrier to entry. There are some ideas to subsidize hardware to encourage participation.\\n\\n### 7. What exactly are the metrics/statistics of some of the \'marketing objectives\' / branding strength is Gnosis offering?\\n\\nThese types of metrics will be developed by a newly created team dedicated to marketing and project/application growth. There will be a strong commitment to growing and promoting the chain. Expect marketing initiatives with defined, transparent goals that have not been possible so far with xDai\u2019s limited marketing resources.\\n\\n### 8. How would the merge affect the existing projects like xDai Punks, xDai Tigers or even De-Fi Platforms like Agave and 1Hive ?\\n\\nGnosisDAO will reserve 400k GNO (\\\\~$190 million) to develop the Gnosis Chain ecosystem and incentivize usage. GnosisDAO can consider adding liquidity to various DeFi protocols on the xDAI chain to support their adoption, including Agave and 1Hive. Aspiring NFT projects like xDai Punks, xDai Tigers and xDai Bots may consider rebranding to support the Gnosis brand (although xDai will still be the native transactional token, so no changes are required).\\n\\n#### Related: What will be the native/gas token of the Gnosis Chain?\\n\\nThe base currency will remain as xDai, with all the benefits of a stable token. Transaction fees will still be paid with xDai. Governance and staking on the beacon chain will use GNO.\\n\\n### 9. Seeing as xDai chain has the potential to offer the Ethereum ecosystem as a cheap and fast scalability solution, why is XDAI team going ahead with this merger proposal at a low conversion rate? All our price discovery potential is ahead of us, why is the team and Gnosis setting a 14-day TWAP price right before token price potentially goes exponential?\\n\\nUnfortunately there is no crystal ball, so it\'s hard to say if the token price was headed in one direction or another. The community expectations for items like the London HF activation or rebranding initiatives (comparing the effort to the Matic -> Polygon rebrand) were likely not in alignment with the reality of the situation.\\n\\n* So far, less than 0.20 xDai has been burned with London activated for 3 days. This will increase if chain usage increases, however at this time the amount burned is insignificant and will not result in any tangible results from associated STAKE burn.\\n* The branding refresh by RaidGuild is nearly finished with the purpose of clearing up confusion among the community and users. There was no planned name change etc. The primary goals include explaining dual token mode, purpose of the STAKE token in the ecosystem, creating new logos which are currently absent, etc.\\n\\n### 10. If the xDai community isn\'t behind this trade will it be forced through by the team and Gnosis? Gnosis holds many hundreds of thousands of STAKE and we know which way they will vote, will they be ruled out of voting on this proposal so that we can see what the xdai community actually wants?\\n\\nThe  GnosisDAO holds 250K STAKE, which makes them part of the community. Signaling snapshot vote is used to capture the sentiment of all STAKE holders. We also plan to potentially prepare multiple signaling snapshot votes to capture community sentiment as much as possible.\\n\\nTechnically STAKE holders cannot stop the swap from happening if GnosisDAO decides to create the swap contract. However, going against the xDai community is not in the interest of GnosisDAO.\\n\\nCurrently it is impossible to discern how STAKE holders are feeling about the proposal overall, there is a very vocal group concerned about the conversion rate. How big this group is and what the sentiment is overall amongst STAKE holders will be captured in the snapshot vote.\\n\\n### 11. As far as I got it, the validation till SBC will be done as it is now by using Stake in the Validator pools. So the merger will happen when SBC goes live?\\n\\nThe current plan is to merge xDai into the Stake/Gnosis Beacon Chain one week ahead of the ETH mainnet merge. Until then the network will be working as it is working now; secured by POSDAO consensus.\\n\\nBeacon chain will be launched only with the GNO token so everyone interested to be a validator will need to swap STAKE into GNO once the swap contract is live. The current proposal is that the swap contract will be live for 6 months, however this may be subject to refinement based on tax implications or other concerns. The endpoint/timeline can be changed if there is support and reasoning to extend or shorten the deadline.\\n\\n### 12. Who\'s idea was this - xDai or Gnosis? How much did the Gnosis team pay the xdai team for this? Do they get the same swap value or did they get other monetary compensation as well?\\n\\nAll terms of the proposal are public and published on the Gnosis and xDai forums. xDai team is not receiving any payments or incentives. xDai team members who hold STAKE have the same swap rate as other holders.\\n\\nxDai team has been looking for investors/partners to support the Eth 2.0 roadmap and accelerate the growth of the chain via new partnerships, marketing, and listings. Gnosis\u2019s investment and partnership can fuel xDai\u2019s expansion by helping the chain grow and optimize its ecosystem and increase its community.\\n\\n### 13. Incentive programs using STAKE, like on Agave, have really helped push liquidity to projects and have helped positively increase mindshare for xdai as a whole. Would there be replacement incentive programs to take place for those done with STAKE to now use GNO instead?\\n\\nThere will definitely be some incentives programs from the GNO side, with a much larger infusion of incentives than have occurred previously. Lack of liquidity has been an ongoing issue for DEXs and other projects deploying on xDai, and has led to users fleeing to other chains with higher liquidity.  Referencing the current proposal, GnosisDAO will reserve 400k GNO (\\\\~$190 million) to develop the Gnosis Chain ecosystem and incentivize usage.\\n\\n### 14. Which network in your opinion would benefit the most with the merge? xDai or Gnosis?\\n\\nOur hope is that both orgs, along with users of the new chain, will benefit. In this alliance based on merged branding and shared tokenomics, marketing will increase, incentives and liquidity will increase, more projects will deploy and greater alignment with the Eth2 ecosystem will be achieved. The xDai team will remain autonomous but have access to more resources, and the Gnosis team will benefit by expanding into a comprehensive & scalable environment.\\n\\n\\n### 15. Which unique aspects of the counterparty\'s chain do you value the most?\\n\\nxDai: Gnosis safe has been a huge benefit to the blockchain space. So many projects and DAOs use it for multi-sig governance. Looking forward, Circles may prove to be something that goes beyond blockchain to help level the playing field for society with a Universal Basic Income. It\u2019s a huge idea and one that Gnosis is committed to. It\u2019s very exciting and potentially life-changing for many people.\\n\\nGnosis: xDai has been committed to building excellent technology that makes Ethereum compatibility scaleable from the get go and is fully aligned with the Gnosis values of fostering network effects without locking users in. Both xDai and Gnosis believe in the power of decentralized technology to empower individuals. However, with the gas price development on Eth1 as it stands, the once very inclusive Ethereum needs compatible layer ones to not price out all users but the biggest whales. To us, xDai is that solution.\\n\\n### 16. I would like to know why Gnosis? In addition to providing money, Gnosis has other ways to raise the STAKE ecosystem? Who will be the CEO after the merger? Will the STAKE team stay in the new company? Does the merger affect the original ecosystem projects - for example SUSHI?\\n\\nIn addition to providing money, Gnosis has other ways to raise the STAKE ecosystem?\\n\\nA new BizDev unit will be established to drive business development and marketing activities of the Gnosis Chain. Such activities will include attracting well-performing and well-known multi-chain protocols to launch on the Gnosis Chain. Gnosis Chain will cover the costs associated with such deployments. A new marketing unit will also be implemented to drive marketing activities of the Gnosis Chain.\\n\\nWho will be the CEO after the merger? Will the STAKE team stay in the new company?\\n\\nGnosisDAO (the entity governed by GNO holders that holds Gnosis assets) does not have a CEO. The CEO for Gnosis the company will  continue to be Martin. Igor will remain the \\"CEO\\" of xDai. Both entities will render services to the Gnosis\\\\DAO.\\n\\nHow do both teams (xDAI and Gnosis) see a successful cooperation in the time after the merger? Will team members be swapped or maybe leave?\\n\\nThere are no organizational changes planned in the xDai core and dev teams. RnD teams in both organizations will remain autonomous. New autonomous units will be created for BizDev and Marketing. All dev talents on the xDai team will be encouraged to stay.\\n\\nDoes the merger affect the original ecological project? For example SUSHI?\\n\\nGnosisDAO can consider adding liquidity to the various DeFi protocols on the xDAI chain to support their adoption using the 400k GNO (\\\\~$190 million) fund reserved for that purpose.\\n\\n### 17. How do you imagine attracting new dev talents to the chain?\\n\\nGnosis team has a well-defined and successful recruiting process and is committed to help hire new developers for the chain and other associated products. Additional units such as BizDev and Marketing will be established to drive adoption of Gnosis chain including a push to hire top talent.\\n\\n### 18. Will you keep the goals (becoming an official ETH testnet with real value in stake) of xDai?\\n\\nGnosis Chain will continue xDai\u2019s intent to follow the Ethereum roadmap as closely as possible. Future goals include:\\n\\n* Offer the highest degree of compatibility between Gnosis Chain and Ethereum\\n* Set up a Gnosis Beacon Chain (in preparation of a later merge)\\n* Develop over time a role similar to what Kusama is to Polkadot"},{"id":"/archive/2021/xdai-weekly-recap-05-11-2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/updates/archive/2021/xdai-weekly-recap-05-11-2021","source":"@site/updates/archive/2021/xdai-weekly-recap-05-11-2021.md","title":"\u2694\ufe0f xDai Weekly Recap - 05/11/2021","description":"Weekly Newsletter","date":"2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 5, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":0.27,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"date":"2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"xDai / Gnosis Merger AMA","permalink":"/updates/archive/2021/xdai-gnosis-merger-ama"},"nextItem":{"title":"\u2694\ufe0f xDai Weekly Recap - 29/10/2021","permalink":"/updates/archive/2021/xdai-weekly-recap-29-10-2021"}},"content":"import ArchiveWarning from \'@site/src/components/ArchiveWarning\';\\n\\n<ArchiveWarning />\\n\\n## Weekly Newsletter\\n\\n:::info\\nIn-depth weekly highlights are on Substack.

During epoch 39 a validator pool was inactivated (mining address[ 0xb76756f95A9fB6ff9ad3E6cb41b734c1bd805103](https://gnosis.blockscout.com/address/0xb76756f95A9fB6ff9ad3E6cb41b734c1bd805103/transactions)) due to excessive downtime.\\n\\nDelegators on this pool (which happened to have the most delegators) received a smaller initial reward due to this downtime and associated block skips. Because staking epoch 39 was one of the first 3 staking epochs for delegators, and information on inactive pools was not readily available, staking rewards were distributed manually via Disperse, an open source built by core YFI contributor Banteg.\\n\\nWe\u2019ve updated our information and FAQs for inactive validators, and we don\u2019t expect a manual distribution to happen again in the future. **With POSDAO staking there are inherent risks, and it is important for delegators to realize these risks and delegate appropriately.**\\n\\nNow that the epoch is complete, participants who delegated on this validator can to move their stake to other pools, claim existing rewards or withdraw as desired.This inactivation also highlighted the need for additional monitoring tools on validator health, and we are working to implement monitoring which will provide additional insights into validator performance. Currently, the Netstat tool at [https://dai-netstat.poa.network](https://dai-netstat.poa.network/) provides basic network performance metrics and can be useful when considering which validators to delegate on. _\\\\*Note several additional non-validating nodes are also shown in the interface._\\n\\n### POAP NFT\\n\\n100 unique delegators have now actively participated in the protocol (with active STAKE in at least 1 staking epoch), and we plan to distribute an exclusive POAP to the first 100 by the end of the month.

We could not have envisioned the level of adoption and number of projects that have flourished on xDai in 2020**. xDai is arguably the #1 most-used L2 scaling solution for Ethereum right now**, and has helped support the ecosystem by providing an option for low-cost, stable transactions while improving interoperability and cross-chain interaction.\\n\\nPrior to 2020, a primary use-case for xDai centered around live events. xDai was experiencing a lot of growth with usage at Ethereum conferences, the Splunk Conference, RSA conference and more. At EthDenver 2020 xDai was used by conference attendees to buy food as well as navigate the conference, vote on hackathon entrants, and earn quest-based NFTs. The EthDenver Burner Wallet was extremely ambitious, pointing a way for the future of xDai as the go-to solution to power conferences and live events.\\n\\nThen live events shut down. xDai could still be used for virtual events (and was adopted by [KickBack](https://xdai.kickback.events/) to host their virtual events) and was still actively used by several projects, such as Grassroots Economics community currencies, but these also relied on face-to-face community interactions. Fortunately, xDai had several things going for it:\\n\\n1. Fast 5 second blocks.\\n2. Stable inexpensive transactions.\\n3. Robust open-source toolset ([BlockScout](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet), [TokenBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/), and more).\\n4. Interoperability, compatibility and synchronicity with Ethereum.\\n5. Long-standing track record as a production blockchain.\\n6. Strong developer and grassroots community.\\n\\nIn 2020 we set out to make xDai stronger and more decentralized by enabling governance and upgrading consensus to POSDAO, our own unique delegated proof-of-stake consensus. We cultivated partnerships, notably a primary partnership with [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/), and worked with many projects and DAOs to find creative solutions to navigate high gas fees on Ethereum.\\n\\nWe set ambitious goals for 2020, and were able to achieve them without compromising chain security, always the #1 directive of the team. Below are some highlights from a very busy year:\\n\\n* **EthDenver 2020**: Before the Covid hit the fan, xDai powered this final large-scale Ethereum event.\\n* **POSDAO Phase 1** (nominated validators): After over a year in development, private POSDAO launched April 1,2020.\\n* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\ud83e\udd69 **STAKE token launch**: A major milestone towards xDai decentralization, the STAKE governance token was offered as an IEO through Bitmax on April 28 and trading opened April 29. It was the first token to participate in the Bitmax pre-staking program. After launch, STAKE was added to other exchanges, both centralized and decentralized. [Exchange list](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xdai-stake#markets).\\n* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\ud83d\udc4d **EasyStaking launch on Ethereum**: EasyStaking launched to enable users on Ethereum to keep their STAKE on Ethereum while earning emission rewards. Rewards are divided between EasyStakers and Liquidity providers on Uniswap. EasyStaking is still a great option for users, and over 1M STAKE are currently in the EasyStaking contract.\\n* **Project migrations / launches**:  Too many to name, see the projects section for a more complete list. Highlights include: [Circles UBI](https://joincircles.net/), [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.fi/), [Nifty.ink](https://nifty.ink/), [DarkForest](https://dark-forest.online/), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/), [POAP](https://www.poap.xyz/), [Vocdoni](https://blog.vocdoni.io/vocdoni-switched-to-xdai-chain/) & [HoneySwap](https://honeyswap.org/#/swap).\\n* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\ud83e\udd1d **Partnerships & Integrations**: Major announcements of integrations with [Gnosis](https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-protocol-and-xdai-partnership-1de0e48fb14b), Chainlink & [HOPR](https://medium.com/hoprnet/hopr-partners-with-xdai-to-launch-incentivized-testnet-for-network-level-data-privacy-3503721d0374).\\n* **DAOs**: DAOs found xDai the perfect solution for community voting and governance processes. DAOHaus, MetaCartel, Raidguild, PrimeDAO and others moved their operations.\\n* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\ud83c\udf09 **OmniBridge**: The omnibridge lets users to easily transfer any ERC20s between Ethereum and xDai. This interoperability solution gives users instant access to Ethereum as needed. The architecture was developed by TokenBridge, and UI a collaborative effort with RaidGuild.\\n* **Reddit competition**: Though no winner has been announced, xDai had a strong showing which brought a lot of attention to the value proposition offered by the xDai stable sidechain. The competition showcased xDai as well as the experimental qDai implementation. [Reddit Gitbook](https://challenge.xdaichain.com/)\\n* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\ud83d\udcb8 **Fiat onramp**: Ramp network integration allows users to buy xDai directly with a debit card.\\n* **BlockScout, TokenBridge, Nethermind, and Dev Tools**: The BlockScout and TokenBridge teams both made major improvements to their open-source products to support the xDai chain. BlockScout introduced the POSDAO staking app, bridged tokens list, contract validation methods and many more features. TokenBridge worked to improve the xDai Bridge and the Omnibridge. [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/) optimized for POSDAO, creating a 2nd client option for nodes. The toolset for developers also expanded with many projects deploying their infrastructure to xDai.\\n* **Governance expansion**: Bridge governance was extended to additional validators, and community voting was enabled through snapshot to further decentralize the xDai chain.\\n* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\u26fd **Gas consumption milestone**: In November, total gas consumed on xDai hit 1,000,000,000,000+. Transactions on xDai steadily increased over the year, with some larger spikes due to Dark Forest, Circles UBI and perp.exchange. xDai is exceeding 80K tx per day as the year comes to a close.\\n* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\ud83d\udcf0 **Media features**: As xDai came into the spotlight as a scalability solution for Ethereum, media outlets also noticed: [Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-gas-fees-drive-gnosis-powered-prediction-market-to-xdais-layer-2), [Bankless](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/an-intro-to-xdai-ethereums-sister), [OurNetwork](https://ournetwork.substack.com/p/issue-45), and more featured coverage of the xDai chain.\\n* \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\ud83c\udf89 **Public POSDAO launch**: The Public POSDAO launch on Dec 23 was a culmination of years of work by the team. Delegation amounts were [lowered to 200 STAKE thanks to a community vote](https://snapshot.page/#/xdaistake.eth/proposal/QmW87yvqQ64t97wj4woee1dBtX1uQSeED8pCqoW2yk5qWs), and the first public rewards were distributed to delegatros. We are very excited to move into 2021 with a network that is more decentralized and secure than ever before!\\n\\nThis brings us to playing DarkForest (DF) as 2020 comes to an end. DF on xDai encapsulates much of what made the year a success. DF leverages xDai to provide a real-time experience for users where they can make 1000s of ZKsnark-based transactions without worrying about tx cost or processing delays. This is done with a customized and reenvisioned burner wallet; blockchain novices can start playing immediately without even knowing they are transacting on a blockchain. It\u2019s a fun, real-time strategy game made possible by xDai\u2019s unique blockchain attributes.\\n\\nVersion 0.4 was first introduced on xDai in August, and the heavy infrastructure demands caused some slowdowns for users. The teams learned from these issues, and xDai and [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/) optimized infrastructure to anticipate tx volume and traffic spikes, creating a much-improved experience this time around.

Look for a postmortem from the DarkForest team soon.\\n\\nWe are excited to continue our optimization efforts with the RPC read layer and this test was a great opportunity to highlight xDai features like a Burner wallet with auto-transaction acceptance (this made the game much more playable) and micro-tx ability for players.

[Additional Weekly Updates](xdai-weekly-recap-25-09-2020.md#weekly-updates-xdai-community) appear following this post.\\n:::\\n\\nOver the past several months we\u2019ve seen a huge increase in users, with dozens of teams moving over to xDai and asset transfers coming in at breathtaking speed! As a result, we are very busy addressing scalability issues related to this influx of new projects and users.\\n\\nOne consequence of our popularity is we are now attracting hackers intent on disrupting the network. Below we talk about a fresh attack, and some of the things we are doing to prevent future bad faith attacks as well steps we are taking to increase speed and network scalability.\\n\\n### **Lessons from a Public Goods Exploit: Bridge Drain Attack**\\n\\n:::info\\n**Note: No user funds are or were at risk from this exploit - the following only relates to validator resources**.\\n:::\\n\\nThis week a black hat hacker decided to run a simple exploit which resulted in some losses for validator accounts on the bridge.  Currently, bridge operations for the xDai -> Dai bridge are subsidized by the project to provide users with relief from high gas prices on Ethereum Network.  In this attack, the hacker converted 1000 DAI to xDai then used a script to withdraw $10 at a time back to Ethereum, resulting in high gas fees for every withdrawal which were paid by bridge validators.\\n\\nAll user funds were safe during this incident, and it highlighted some known issues with the Dai -> xDai bridge, mainly that it operates with a trusted setup, a limited validator set, and subsidized fees. Adjustments were made to prevent further drains from this malicious actor and avoid similar types of exploits, which resulted in bridge issues for other honest users. While inconvenient, this attack helped our team propose some immediate adjustments (including fast tracking a more decentralized governance protocol!) and reprioritize some of our upcoming work to address potential future issues.\\n\\n#### Governance Updates:\\n\\nBridge management is vital to reacting to different circumstances with the bridge, such as increased funds moving in, attacks, or any issues with the current bridge management set (governors). The 3/4 multisig is not robust enough to handle growing bridge usage, so we are implementing a Gnosis safe to simplify bridge management and include up to 11 governors to start. Governors are community members who have expressed a willingness to participate and 6/11 signatures will be required to enact a proposal assuming all 11 join. This group will also be able to adjust and extend the management set through a governance process. In addition, they can decide to upgrade the contracts and parameters (like fees, limits etc) as needed to respond to dynamic conditions. More on the process and governors:[ https://forum.poa.network/t/increase-number-of-participants-in-the-xdai-bridge-management-multsigs/3773](https://forum.poa.network/t/increase-number-of-participants-in-the-xdai-bridge-management-multsigs/3773)\\n\\n#### Bridge Limits:\\n\\nBridge limits were adjusted this week with the current governance set to allow for larger deposits and withdrawals, as well as increasing the amount for a single max and minimum withdrawal from the bridge.  Bridge Limits: [https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/converting-xdai-via-bridge#dai-xdai-bridge-limits](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/converting-xdai-via-bridge#dai-xdai-bridge-limits)\\n\\n#### Optimistic Bridge Priority:\\n\\nAs we can see there is a need for an additional trustless bridge solution. We have proposed an optimistic model and are currently receiving feedback and planning our implementation strategy.  We have increased the prioritization for this task and will devote additional resources to push it forward more quickly. Learn more: [https://ethresear.ch/t/optimistic-bridge-between-mainnet-and-a-pos-chain/7965](https://ethresear.ch/t/optimistic-bridge-between-mainnet-and-a-pos-chain/7965)\\n\\n#### Addressing Increased Load:\\n\\nIn addition to attracting hackers, we also have many more users which are pushing the network and infrastructure in new ways. We are addressing these issues by adding more servers to the load balancers for RPC nodes and optimizing the bridge UI to decrease load on the load balancer. We will increase our monitoring and look to address loading issues proactively going forward.\\n\\nWe always maintain hope that future hackers will bring issues to us which can be worked with in a productive way for the network and the community as a whole rather than for attention or some other unknown motive. However, we realize this is unrealistic and will continue to be vigilant and hone and prepare our defenses in anticipation of the next attack.\\n\\n:pray: Through this ordeal, we certainly appreciate our community response. Our bridge infrastructure, like everything in the blockchain ecosystem, is a work in progress. We are constantly working to fine tune, institute best practices and resolve issues as we find them. xDai is strong and only growing stronger, thanks to our community of supporters and detractors.\\n\\n## Weekly Updates - xDai Community\\n\\n### \u2713 STAKEhaus DAO\\n\\nA DAO for and by the xDai Community.
